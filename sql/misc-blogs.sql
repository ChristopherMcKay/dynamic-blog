(1, 'French Cuisine - Part 2', 'Haute means High', '<h3>Haute cuisine</h3>\r\n<p>France''s famous Haute cuisine — literally "high cuisine" — has its foundations during the seventeenth century with a chef named François Pierre La Varenne. As author of works such as Cvisinier françois, he is credited with publishing the first true French cookbook. His book includes the earliest known reference to roux using pork fat. The book contained two sections, one for meat days, and one for fasting. His recipes marked a change from the style of cookery known in the Middle Ages to new techniques aimed at creating somewhat lighter dishes, and more modest presentations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>La Varenne also published a book on pastry in 1667 entitled Le Parfait confitvrier (republished as Le Confiturier françois) which similarly updated and codified the emerging haute cuisine standards for desserts and pastries.[4]</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Marie-Antoine Carême French chef and author who simplifed and codifed the style of cooking known as haute cuisine.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The French Revolution</h3>\r\n<p>The Revolution was integral to the expansion of French cuisine, because it effectively abolished the guilds. This meant that any one chef could now produce and sell any culinary item he wished. Marie-Antoine Carême was born in 1784, five years before the onset of the Revolution. He spent his younger years working at a pâtisserie until being discovered by Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord who would later cook for the French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. Prior to his employment with Talleyrand, Carême had become known for his pièces montèes, which were extravagant constructions of pastry and sugar architecture.[5]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More important to Carême''s career was his contribution to the refinement of French cuisine. The basis for his style of cooking came from his sauces, which he named mother sauces. Often referred to as fonds, meaning foundations, these base sauces, espagnole, velouté, and béchamel are still prepared today.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Brigade system - early twentieth century</h3>\r\n<p>Georges Auguste Escoffier, commonly acknowledged as the central figure to the modernization of haute cuisine, organized what would come to be regarded as the national cuisine of France. His influence began with the rise of some of the great hotels in Europe and America during the 1880s - 1890s. The Savoy Hotel owned by César Ritz was an early hotel Escoffier worked for, but much of his influence came during his management of the kitchens in the Carlton from 1898 until 1921. He created a system of parties called the brigade system, which separated the professional kitchen into five separate stations. These five stations included the garde manger that prepared cold dishes; the entremettier prepared soups, vegetables and desserts; the rôtisseur prepared roasts, grilled and fried dishes; the saucier prepared sauces; and the pâtissier prepared all pastry items. This system meant that instead of one person preparing a dish on their own, now multiple cooks would prepare the different components for each dish.[6]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps Escoffier''s largest contribution to French cuisine was - his pièce de résistance- the publication of Le Guide Culinaire in 1903, which established the fundamentals of French cookery. Escoffier, who himself invented many new dishes, such as pêche Melba and crêpes Suzette updated Le Guide Culinaire four times during his lifetime.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Nouvelle cuisine - late twentieth century</h3>\r\n<p>Paul Bocuse is a French chef, considered one of the finest cooks of the twentieth century\r\nThe term nouvelle cuisine has been used many times in the history of French cuisine.[7] The first characteristic of nouvelle cuisine was a rejection of excessive complication in cooking. Secondly, the cooking times for most fish, seafood, game birds, veal, green vegetables and pâtés was greatly reduced in an attempt to preserve the natural flavors. Steaming became an important trend. Thirdly, using the freshest possible ingredients became of paramount importance. Additional changes included: larger menus being abandoned in favor of shorter menus; strong marinades for meat and game were cut down on; heavy sauces such as espagnole and béchamel thickened with roux were used less in favor of seasoning dishes with fresh herbs, butter, lemon juice, and vinegar. Regional dishes were drawn upon for inspiration instead of haute cuisine dishes of the past. New techniques were embraced and modern equipment was often used, including microwave ovens. Closer attention to the dietary needs of guests became important and, finally, chefs became extremely inventive and created new combinations and pairings.[7]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some have speculated that a contributor to nouvelle cuisine was World War II when animal protein was in short supply during the German occupation.[8] No matter what the origins were, by the mid-1980s some food writers stated that the style of cuisine had reached exhaustion and many chefs began returning to the haute cuisine style of cooking, although much of the lighter presentations and new techniques remained.[7]</p>', 1, '2018-12-13 20:01:29'),
(2, 'French Cuisine - Part 1', 'Overview and Introduction to French Cuisine', '<p>French cuisine is a style of cooking derived from the nation of France. It evolved through centuries of social and political change. The Middle Ages heralded in lavish banquets among the upper classes with ornate, heavily seasoned food while the era of the French Revolution saw a move toward fewer spices and a more liberal use of herbs. More refined techniques for preparing French food developed with Marie-Antoine Carême, famed chef to Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>French cuisine was more fully developed in the late nineteenth century by Georges Auguste Escoffier and became what is now referred to as haute cuisine. Escoffier''s major treatise on French cooking (Le Guide Culinaire), however, left out much of the regional character found in the provinces of France. The move to an appreciation of provincial French food began with the Michelin Guide (Le Guide Michelin) and the trend to gastro-tourism during the twentieth century.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>National cuisine</h3>\r\n<p>French cuisine has evolved extensively over the centuries. Starting in the Middle Ages, a unique and creative national cuisine began forming. Various social movements, political movements, and the work of great chefs came together to create the techniques and style unique to French cooking renowned throughout the world. Through the years French cuisine has been given different names, and has been codified by various master-chefs. During their lifetimes these chefs have been held in high regard for their contributions to the culture of the country. The national cuisine which developed primarily in the city of Paris with the chefs to French royalty, eventually spread throughout the country and was ultimately exported overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3.>History Middle Ages</h3>\r\n<p>John, Duke of Berry enjoying a grand meal. The Duke is sitting with a cardinal at the high table, under a luxurious baldaquin, in front of the fireplace, tended to by several servants including a carver. On the table to the left of the Duke is a golden salt cellar, or nef, in the shape of a ship; illustration from Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, ca. 1410.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In French medieval cuisine, banquets were common among the aristocracy. Multiple courses would be prepared, but served in a style called service en confusion, literally ''all at once''. Food was generally eaten with the hands, meats being sliced off large pieces held between the thumb and two fingers. The sauces of the time were highly seasoned and thick, and heavily flavored mustards were used. Pies were also a common banquet item, with the crust serving primarily as a container, rather than as food itself, and it was not until the very end of the Late Middle Ages that the shortcrust pie was developed. Meals often ended with an issue de table, which later evolved into the modern dessert, and typically consisted of dragees (in the Middle Ages meaning spiced lumps of hardened sugar or honey), aged cheese and spiced wine, such as hypocras.[1]</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Royalty and the ''New World’</h3>\r\n<p>During the ancien régime Paris was the central hub of culture and economic activity, and as such the most highly skilled culinary craftsmen were found there. Markets in Paris such as Les Halles, la Mégisserie, those found along Rue Mouffetard, and similar smaller versions in other cities were very important to the distribution of food. Those that gave French produce its characteristic identity were regulated by the guild system, which developed in the Middle Ages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guillaume Tirel, alias Taillevent, lived from 1310 – 1395 and was the chef to several French kings, including Philip VI, Charles V and Charles VI from around 1325. He wrote a famous book on cookery titled Le Viandier that was influential on subsequent books about French cuisine and important to food historians as a detailed source on the medieval cuisine of northern France. Today, many restaurants named "Taillevent" capitalize on the reputation of Guillaume Tirel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, French cuisine assimilated many new food items from the New World. Although they were slow to be adopted, records of banquets show Catherine de'' Medici serving 66 turkeys at one dinner.[2] The dish called cassoulet has its roots in the New World discovery of haricot beans, which are central to the dish''s creation but had not existed outside of the New World until its exploration by Christopher Columbus.[3]</p>', 1, '2018-12-13 20:01:29'),
(3, 'French Cuisine - Part 3', 'The Regional Cuisine of Franch', '<h3>Regional Cuisine</h3>\r\n<p>The 22 regions and 96 departments of metropolitan France include Corsica (Corse, lower right). Paris area is expanded (inset at left). Ingredients and dishes vary by region and some regional dishes have gained national popularity. Cheese and wine are a major part of the cuisine, playing different roles both regionally and nationally with their many variations and Appellation d''origine contrôlée (AOC) (regulated appellation) laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>French regional cuisine is characterized by a wide range of diversity and styles. Traditionally, each region of France has its own distinctive cuisine.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paris • Ile-de-France</h3>\r\n<p>Paris and Ile-de-France are central regions where almost anything from the entire country is available as all train lines meet in the city. Over 5,000 restaurants exist in Paris and almost any cuisine from any country can be found. High-quality Michelin Guide rated restaurants proliferate here.[9]</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Champagne • Lorraine• Alsace</h3>\r\n<p>Wild game and ham are popular in Champagne as well as the special sparkling wine simply known as Champagne. Fine fruit preserves come from Lorraine (region) as well as the famous Quiche Lorraine. Alsace is heavily influenced by the German food culture and therefore the wines and beers are very similar to the style of those bordering Germany.[10]</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Nord • Pas de Calais • Picardy • Normandy • Brittany</h3>\r\n<p>The coastline supplies many crustaceans, sea bass, monkfish, and herring. Normandy has quality seafood such as scallops and sole, while Brittany has a supply of lobster, crayfish and mussels. Normandy, home to apple orchards, uses apples in many dishes such as cider and calvados. The northern areas of this region especially Nord, grow ample amounts of wheat, sugar beet and chicory. Thick stews are found in these northern areas as well. The produce, considered some of the best in the country, includes cauliflower and artichokes. Buckwheat grows widely in Brittany and is used in the region''s galettes called jalet, which is where this dish originated.[11]</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Loire Valley • Central France</h3>\r\n<p>High quality fruits come from the Loire Valley and central France, including cherries grown for the liqueur Guignolet and the Belle Angevine pears. The strawberries and melons are also of high quality. Fish are seen in the cuisine as well as wild game, lamb, calves, Charolais cattle, Géline fowl, and high quality goat cheeses. Young vegetables are used often in the cuisine as are the specialty mushrooms of the region, champignons de Paris. Vinegars from Orléans are a specialty ingredient used as well.[12]</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Burgundy • Franche-Comté</h3>\r\n<p>Burgundy is well known for its wines. Pike, perch, river crabs, snails, poultry from Bresse, Charolais beef or game, redcurrants, blackcurrants, honey cake, Chaource and Epoisses cheese are all specialties of the local cuisine of both Burgundy and Franche-Comté. Kir and Crème de Cassis are popular liquors made from black currants. Dijon mustard is also a specialty of Burgundy cuisine. Oils are used in the cooking here; types include nut oils and rapeseed oil. Smoked meat and specialties are produced in the Jura[13]</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Lyon • Rhône-Alpes</h3>\r\n<p>Fruit and young vegetables are popular in the cuisine from the Rhône valley. Poultry from Bresse, guinea fowls from Drôme and fish from the Dombes lakes and mountains in Rhône-Alpes are key to the cuisine as well. Lyon and Savoy supply high quality sausages while the Alpine regions supply their specialty cheeses like Abondance, Reblochon, Tomme and Vacherin. Mères lyonnaises are a particular type of restaurateur relegated to this region that are the regions'' bistro. Celebrated chefs from this region include Fernand Point, Paul Bocuse, the Troisgros brothers and Alain Chapel. The Chartreuse Mountains are in this region, and the famous liquor Chartreuse is produced in a monastery there.[14]</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Poitou-Charentes • Limousin</h3>\r\n<p>Oysters come from the Oléron-Marennes basin while mussels come from the Bay of Aiguillon. High quality produce comes from the regions hinterland. Goat cheese is of high quality in this region and in the Vendée there is grazing ground for Parthenaise cattle, while poultry is raised in Challans. Poitou and Charente purportedly produce the best butter and cream in France. Cognac is also produced in the region along the Charente River. Limousin is home to the high quality Limousin cattle as well as high quality sheep. The woodlands offer game and high quality mushrooms. The southern area around Brive draws its cooking influence from Périgord and Auvergne to produce a robust cuisine.[15]</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Bordeaux • Perigord • Gascony • Pays Basque</h3>\r\n<p>Bordeaux is well known for its wine, as it is throughout the southwest of France with certain areas offering specialty grapes for its wines. Fishing is popular in the region, especially the Pays Basque deep-sea fishing of the North Sea, trapping in the Garonne and stream fishing in the Pyrenees. The Pyrenees also support top quality lamb such as the "Agneau de Pauillac" as well as high quality sheep cheeses. Beef cattle in the region include the Blonde d''Aquitaine, Boeuf de Challose, Bazardaise, and Garonnaise. High quality free-range chickens, turkey, pigeon, capon, goose and duck prevail in the region as well. Gascony and Perigord cuisines includes high quality patés, terrines, confits and magrets. This is one of the regions famous for its production of foie gras or fattened goose or duck liver. The cuisine of the region is often heavy and farm based. Armagnac is also from this region as are high quality prunes from Agen.[16]</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Toulouse • Quercy • Aveyron</h3>\r\n<p>Gers in this region offers high quality poultry, while La Montagne Noire and Lacaune area offers high quality hams and dry sausages. White corn is planted heavily in the area both for use in fattening the ducks and geese for foie gras as well as for the production of millas, a cornmeal porridge. Haricot beans are also grown in this area, which are central to the dish Cassoulet. The finest sausage in France is commonly acknowledged to be the saucisse de Toulouse, which also finds its way into their version of Cassoulet of Toulouse. The Cahors area produces a high quality specialty "black wine" as well as high-quality truffles and mushrooms. This region also produces milk-feed lamb. Unpasteurized ewe''s milk is used to produce the Roquefort in Aveyron, while Cantal is produced in Laguiole. The Salers cattle produce quality milk for cheese, as well as beef items. The volcanic soils create flinty cheeses and superb lentils. Mineral waters are produced in high volume in this region as well.[17]\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Roussillon • Languedoc • Cévennes</h3>\r\n<p>Restaurants are popular in the area known as Le Midi. Oysters come from the Etang de Thau, to be served in the restaurants of Bouzigues, Meze, and Sète. Mussels are commonly seen here in addition to fish specialties of Sète, Bourride, Tielles and Rouille de seiche. Also in the Languedoc jambon cru, sometimes known as jambon de montagne is produced. High quality Roquefort comes from the brebis (sheep) on the Larzac plateau. The Les Cévennes area offers mushrooms, chestnuts, berries, honey, lamb, game, sausages, pâtés and goat cheeses. Catalan influence can be seen in the cuisine here with dishes like brandade made from a purée of dried cod which is then wrapped in mangold leaves. Snails are also plentiful and are prepared in a specific Catalan style known as a cargolade. Wild boar can also be found in the more mountainous regions of the Midi.[18]</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Provence • Côte d''Azur</h3>\r\n<p>The Provence and Côte d''Azur region is rich in quality citrus, vegetables and fruits and herbs. The region is one of the largest supplier of all of these ingredients in France. The region also produces the largest amount of olives and thus creates superb olive oil. Lavender is used in many dishes found in the Haute Provence. Other important herbs in the cuisine include thyme, sage, rosemary, basil, savory, fennel, marjoram, tarragon, oregano, and bay leaf. Honey is another prized ingredient in the region. Seafood proliferates in this area. Goat cheeses, air-dried sausage, lamb, and beef are also popular here. Garlic and anchovies can be seen in many of the sauces in the region and Pastis can be found in many of the bistros of the area. The cuisine uses a large amount of vegetables for lighter preparations. Truffles are commonly seen in Provence during the winter. Rice can be found growing in the Camargue, which is the most-northerly rice growing area in Europe, with Camargue red rice being a specialty.[19]</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Corsica</h3>\r\n<p>Goats and sheep proliferate on the island of Corsica, kid goats and lamb are used to prepare dishes such as stufato, ragouts and roasts. Cheeses are also produced with brocciu being the most popular. Chestnuts, growing in the Castagniccia forest, are used to produce flour which in turn is used to make bread, cakes and polenta. The forest also provides acorns which are used to feed the pigs which provide most of the protein for the island''s cuisine. As Corsica is an island, fresh fish and seafood are common in the cuisine as well. The island''s pork is used to make fine hams, sausage and other unique items including coppa (dried rib cut), lonzu (dried pork fillet), figatella, salumu (a dried sausage) salcietta, Panzetta, bacon, figarettu (smoked and dried liverwurst) and prisuttu (farmer''s ham). Clementines (hold an AOC designation), Nectarines and figs are grown there and candied citron is used in nougats, cakes, while the aforementioned brocciu and chestnuts are also used in desserts. Corsica also offers a variety of fruit wines and liqueurs, including Cap Corse, Cédratine, Bonapartine, liquer de myrte, vins de fruit, Rappu, and eau-de-vie de châtaigne.[20]</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Specialties by Season</h3>\r\n<p>French cuisine varies according to the season. In summer, salads and fruit dishes are popular because they are refreshing and the fresh local produce is inexpensive and abundant. Green grocers prefer to sell their fruit and vegetables at lower prices if needed, rather than see them rot in the heat. At the end of summer, mushrooms become plentiful and appear in stews everywhere in France. The hunting season starts in September and runs through February. Wild game of all kinds is eaten, often in very elaborate dishes that celebrate the success of the hunt. Shellfish are at their peak as winter turns to spring, and oysters appear in restaurants in large quantities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the advent of deep-freeze and the air-conditioned hypermarché, these seasonal variations are less marked than previously, but they are still observed. Crayfish, for example, have a very short season and it is illegal to harvest them outside of that time period.[21]</p>\r\n', 1, '2018-12-13 20:03:04'),
(4, 'French Cuisine - Part 4', 'Delicacies - "délicatesses” - Structure of meals - Breakfast', '<h3>Delicacies - "délicatesses” - Structure of meals - Breakfast</h3>\r\n\r\n<hCafés often offer Croissants for breakfast.\r\n<p>Le petit déjeuner (breakfast) is often a quick meal consisting of croissants, butter and jam, eggs or ham along with coffee or tea. Children often drink hot chocolate along with their breakfast. Breakfast of some kind is always served in cafés opening early in the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Lunch</h3>\r\n<p>Le déjeuner (lunch) was once a two hour mid-day meal but has recently seen a trend toward the one hour lunch break. In some smaller towns the two hour lunch may still be customary. Sunday lunches are often longer and are spent with the family.[22] Restaurants normally open for lunch at noon and close at 2:30 P.M. Many restaurants close on Saturday and Monday during the lunch hour.[23]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In large cities a majority of working people and students eat their lunch at a corporate or school cafeteria; it is therefore not usual for students to bring their own lunch food. It is common for white-collar workers to be given lunch vouchers as part of their employee benefits. These can be used in most restaurants, supermarkets and traiteurs; however workers having lunch in this way typically do not eat all three dishes of a traditional lunch due to price and time considerations. In smaller cities and towns, some working people leave their workplaces to return home for lunch, generating four rush hours during the day. Finally, a popular alternative, especially among blue-collar workers, is to lunch on a sandwich possibly followed with a dessert; both items can be found ready-made at bakeries and supermarkets at a reasonable cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Dinner</h3>\r\n<p>Le dîner (dinner) often consists of three courses, hors d''oeuvre or entrée (introductory course often soup), plat principal (main course), and a cheese course or dessert, sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert. Yogurt may replace the cheese course, while a normal everyday dessert would be fresh fruit. The meal is often accompanied by bread, wine and mineral water. Wine consumption by young people has been dropping in recent years. Fruit juice consumption has risen from 25.6 percent in 1996 to 31.6 percent in 2002. Main meat courses are often served with vegetables along with rice or pasta.[24] Restaurants often open at 7:30 P.M. for dinner and stop taking orders between the hours of 10:00 and 11:00 P.M. Many restaurants close for dinner on Sundays.[25]</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Wine</h3>\r\n<p>Traditionally, France has been a culture of wine consumption. While this characteristic has lessened with time, even today, many French people drink wine daily. However, the consumption of low-quality wines during meals has been greatly reduced. Beer is especially popular with the young. Other popular alcoholic drinks include pastis, an aniseed flavored beverage drunk diluted with cold water, or cider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The legal age for purchasing alcohol is 16; however, parents tend to prohibit their children from consuming alcohol before they reach early adulthood. While public consumption of alcohol is legal, driving under the influence can result in severe penalties.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Dining out - Places to dine out</h3>\r\n<p>Restaurants - Over 5,000 in Paris alone, with varying levels of prices and menus. Open at certain times of the day, and normally closed one day of the week. Patrons select items from a printed menu. Some offer regional menus, while others offer a modern style menu. By law, a ''prix-fixe'' menu must be offered, although high-class restaurants may try to conceal the fact. Few French restaurants cater to vegetarians. The Guide Michelin rates many of the better restaurants in this category.[26]\r\nBistro(t) - Often smaller than a restaurant and may use a chalk board or verbal menu. Many feature a regional cuisine. Notable dishes include coq au vin, pot-au-feu, confit de canard, calves'' liver and entrecôte.[26]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bistrot à Vin - Similar to caberets or tavernes of the past in France. Some offer inexpensive alcoholic drinks, while others take pride in offering a full range of vintage AOC wines. The foods are simple, including sausages, ham and cheese, while others offer dishes similar to what can be found in a bistro.[26]</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A bouchon, Le tablier (the apron), in Vieux Lyon.</h3>\r\n<p>Bouchon - Found in Lyon, they produce traditional Lyonnaise cuisine, such as sausages, duck pâté or roast pork. The dishes can be quite fatty, and heavily oriented around meat. There are about twenty officially certified traditional bouchons, but a larger number of establishments describe themselves using the term.[27]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brasserie - French for brewery, these establishments were created in the 1870s by refugees from Alsace-Lorraine. These establishments serve beer, but most serve wines from Alsace such as Riesling, Sylvaner, and Gewürztraminer. The most popular dishes are Sauerkraut and Seafood dishes.[26] In general, a brasserie is open all day, offering the same menu.[28]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Café - Primarily locations for coffee and alcoholic drinks. Tables and chairs are usually set outside, and prices marked up somewhat en terrasse. The limited foods sometimes offered include croque-monsieur, salads, moules-frites (mussels and pommes frites) when in season. Cafés often open early in the morning and shut down around nine at night.[26]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Salon de Thé - These locations are more similar to cafés in the rest of the world. These tearooms often offer a selection of cakes and do not offer alcoholic drinks. Many offer simple snacks, salads, and sandwiches. Teas, hot chocolate, and chocolat à l''ancienne (a popular chocolate drink) is offered as well. These locations often open just prior to noon for lunch and then close late afternoon.[26]\r\nBar - Based on the American style, many were built at the beginning of the twentieth century. These locations serve cocktails, whiskey, pastis and other alcoholic drinks.[26]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Estaminet - Typical of the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region, these small bars/restaurants used to be a central place for farmers, mine or textile workers to meet and socialize. Alongside the usual beverages (beers, liquors…), one could order basic regional dishes, as well as play various indoor games. At one time, these estaminets almost disappeared, but are now considered a part of Nord-Pas-de-Calais history, and are therefore preserved and promoted.</p>', 1, '2018-12-13 20:03:40'),
(5, 'Newton Principia - Part 1', 'That Newton guy sure was smart', '<h3>Overview: The Importance of the Work</h3>\r\n<p>Viewed retrospectively, no work was more seminal in the development of modern physics and astronomy than Newton''s Principia. Its conclusion that the force retaining the planets in their orbits is one in kind with terrestrial gravity ended forever the view dating back at least to Aristotle that the celestial realm calls for one science and the sublunar realm, another. Just as the Preface to its first edition had proposed, the ultimate success of Newton''s theory of gravity made the identification of the fundamental forces of nature and their characterization in laws the primary pursuit of physics. The success of the theory led as well to a new conception of exact science under which every systematic discrepancy between observation and theory, no matter how small, is taken as telling us something important about the world. And, once it became clear that the theory of gravity provided a far more effective means than observation for precisely characterizing complex orbital motions — just as Newton had proposed in the Principia in the case of the orbit of the Moon — physical theory gained primacy over observation for purposes of answering specific questions about the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The retrospective view of the Principia has been different in the aftermath of Einstein''s special and general theories of relativity from what it was throughout the nineteenth century. Newtonian theory is now seen to hold only to high approximation in limited circumstances in much the way that Galileo''s and Huygens''s results for motion under uniform gravity came to be seen as holding only to high approximation in the aftermath of Newtonian inverse-square gravity. In the middle of the nineteenth century, however, when there was no reason to think that any confuting discrepancy between Newtonian theory and observation was ever going to emerge, the Principia was viewed as the exemplar of perfection in empirical science in much the way that Euclid''s Elements had been viewed as the exemplar of perfection in mathematics at the beginning of the seventeenth century. Because of the extent to which Einsteinian theory was grounded historically on Newtonian science, the Principia has retained its unique seminal position in the history of physics in our post-Newtonian era. Perhaps more strikingly, because of the logical relationship between Newtonian and Einsteinian theory — Einstein showed that Newtonian gravity holds as a limit-case of general relativity in just the way Newton showed (in Book 1, Section 10) that Galilean uniform gravity holds as a limit-case of inverse-square gravity — even though the Principia can no longer be regarded as an exemplar of perfection, it is still widely regarded by physicists as an exemplar of empirical science at its best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In spite of extravagant claims made about the Principia by some in the years after it first appeared — “… he seems to have exhausted his Argument, and left little to be done by those that shall succeed him”[1] — the most positive view of it that anyone could have substantiated during the first half of the eighteenth century would have emphasized its promise more than its achievements. The theory of gravity had too many loose ends, the most glaring of which was a factor of 2 discrepancy in the mean motion of the lunar apogee, a discrepancy that undercut the claim that the Moon is held in orbit by an inverse-square force. No one knew these loose ends better than Newton himself, yet no one had a greater sense of the potential of the theory of gravity to resolve a whole host of questions in planetary astronomy — which may well explain why he made these loose ends difficult to see except by the most technically skilled, careful readers. Between the late 1730s and the early 1750s the situation changed dramatically when several of the loose ends were tied up, in some cases yielding such extraordinary results as the first truly successful descriptive account of the motion of the Moon in the history of astronomy. During the second half of the eighteenth century the promise of the Principia was not only universally recognized by those active in empirical research, but a large fraction of this promise was realized. What we now call “Newtonian mechanics” emerged in this process, as did the gravity-based accounts of the often substantial divergences of the planets from Keplerian motion, the achievement of Newton''s theory of gravity that ultimately ended all opposition to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the eighteenth century the Principia was also seen as putting forward a world view directly in opposition to the broadly Cartesian world view that in many circles had taken over from the Scholastic world view during the second half of the seventeenth century. Newton clearly intended the work to be viewed in this way when in 1686 he changed its title to Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, in allusion to Descartes''s most prominent work at the time, Principia Philosophiae. (The title page of Newton''s first edition underscored this allusion by placing the first and third words of the title in larger type.) The main difference in the world view in Newton''s Principia was to rid the celestial spaces of vortices carrying the planets. Newtonians subsequently went beyond Newton in enhancing this world view in various ways, including forces everywhere expressly acting at a distance. The “clockwork universe” aspect of the Newtonian world view, for example, is not to be found in the Principia; it was added by Laplace late in the eighteenth century, after the success of the theory of gravity in accounting for complex deviations from Keplerian motion became fully evident.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to viewing the theory of gravity as potentially transforming orbital astronomy, Newton saw the Principia as illustrating a new way of doing natural philosophy. One aspect of this new way, announced in the Preface to the first edition, was the focus on forces:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the whole difficulty of philosophy seems to be to discover the forces of nature from the phenomena of motions and then to demonstrate the other phenomena from these forces. It is to these ends that the general propositions in books 1 and 2 are directed, while in book 3 our explication of the system of the world illustrates these propositions. For in book 3, by means of propositions demonstrated mathematically in books 1 and 2, we derive from celestial phenomena the gravitational forces by which bodies tend toward the sun and toward the individual planets. Then the motions of the planets, the comets, the moon, and the sea are deduced from these forces by propositions that are also mathematical. If only we could derive the other phenomena of nature from mechanical principles by the same kind of reasoning! For many things lead me to have a suspicion that all phenomena may depend on certain forces by which particles of bodies, by causes not yet known, either are impelled toward one another and cohere in regular figures, or are repelled from one another and recede. Since these forces are unknown, philosophers have hitherto made trial of nature in vain. But I hope that the principles set down here will shed some light on either this mode of philosophizing or some truer one. [P, 382][2]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A second aspect of the new method concerns the use of mathematical theory not to derive testable conclusions from hypotheses, as Galileo and Huygens had done, but to cover a full range of alternative theoretical possibilities, enabling the empirical world then to select among them. This new approach is spelled out most forcefully at the end of Book 1, Section 11:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I use the word “attraction” here in a general sense for any endeavor whatever of bodies to approach one another, whether that endeavor occurs as a result of the action of the bodies either drawn toward one another or acting on one another by means of spirits emitted or whether it arises from the action of ether or of air or of any medium whatsoever — whether corporeal or incorporeal — in any way impelling toward one another the bodies floating therein. I use the word “impulse” in the same general sense, considering in this treatise not the species of forces and their physical qualities but their quantities and mathematical proportions, as I have explained in the definitions. Mathematics requires an investigation of those quantities of forces and their proportions that follow from any conditions that may be supposed. Then, coming down to physics, these proportions must be compared with the phenomena, so that it may be found out which conditions of forces apply to each kind of attracting bodies. And then, finally, it will be possible to argue more securely concerning the physical species, physical causes, and physical proportions of these forces. [P, 588]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A third aspect of the new method, which proved most controversial at the time, was the willingness to hold questions about the mechanism through which forces effect their changes in motion in abeyance, even when the mathematical theory of the species and proportions of the forces seemed to leave no alternative but action at a distance. This aspect remained somewhat tacit in the first edition, but then, in response to criticisms it received, was made polemically explicit in the General Scholium added at the end of the second edition:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have not as yet been able to deduce from phenomena the reason for these properties of gravity, and I do not feign hypotheses. For whatever is not deduced from the phenomena must be called a hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, or based on occult qualities, or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy. In this experimental philosophy, propositions are deduced from the phenomena and are made general by induction. The impenetrability, mobility, and impetus of bodies and the laws of motion and law of gravity have been found by this method. And it is enough that gravity should really exist and should act according to the laws that we have set forth and should suffice for all the motions of the heavenly bodies and of our sea. [P, 943][3]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During most of the eighteenth century the primary challenge the Principia presented to philosophers revolved around what to make of a mathematical theory of forces in the absence of a mechanism, other than action at a distance, through which these forces work. By the last decades of the century, however, little room remained for questioning whether gravity does act according to the laws that Newton had set forth and does suffice for all the motions of the heavenly bodies and of our sea. No one could deny that a science had emerged that, at least in certain respects, so far exceeded anything that had ever gone before that it stood alone as the ultimate exemplar of science generally. The challenge to philosophers then became one of spelling out first the precise nature and limits of the knowledge attained in this science and then how, methodologically, this extraordinary advance had been achieved, with a view to enabling other areas of inquiry to follow suit.</p>\r\n', 2, '2018-12-13 20:04:22');

(6, 'Newton Principia - Part 2', 'It all started with a falling Apple, prior to which no one had ever wondered why things fall in a downward direction', '<h3>The Historical Context of the Principia<./h3>\r\n<p>The view is commonplace that what Newton did was to put forward his theory of gravity to explain Kepler''s already established “laws” of orbital motion; and the universality of the law of gravity then ended up explaining the deviations from Keplerian motion by attributing them to gravitational interaction of the planets. This is wrong on several counts, the most immediate of which is that Kepler''s “laws” were by no means established before the Principia. The rules for calculating orbital motion that Kepler put forward in the first two decades of the seventeenth century had indeed achieved a spectacular gain in accuracy over anything that had come before. Kepler''s rules, however, did not yield comparable accuracy for the motion of the Moon, and even in the case of the planets the calculated locations were sometimes off by as much as a fourth of the width of the Moon. More importantly, by 1680 several other approaches to calculating the orbits had been put forward that achieved the same level of not quite adequate accuracy as Kepler''s. In particular, Newton was familiar with seven different approaches to calculating planetary orbits, all at roughly the same accuracy. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only two of these, Kepler''s and Jeremiah Horrocks''s, used Kepler''s area rule — planets sweep out equal areas in equal times with respect to the Sun — to locate planets along their trajectories. Ismaël Boulliau and, following him, Thomas Streete (from whose Astronomia Carolina Newton first learned orbital astronomy) replaced the area rule with a geometric construction. Vincent Wing had adopted still another geometric construction in the late 1660s after having earlier used a point of equal angular motion oscillating about the empty focus of the ellipse; and Nicolaus Mercator in 1676 added still a further geometric construction.[4] Of these six alternative approaches, only Horrocks and, following him, Streete, took Kepler''s 3/2 power rule — the periods of the planets vary as the square root of the cube of their mean distances from the Sun — seriously enough to use the periods rather than positional observations to determine their mean distances.[5]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All these approaches followed Kepler in using an ellipse to represent the trajectory. (The primary historical reason for this was Kepler''s success in predicting the 1631 transit of Mercury across the Sun.) This, however, does not mean that the ellipse was established as anything more than a mathematically tractable close approximation to the true orbit. In fact, the planetary orbits known then are not all that elliptical. The minor axis of Mercury is only 2 percent shorter than the major axis, the minor axis of Mars, only 0.4 percent shorter, and in all other cases the difference between an ellipse and an eccentric circle was beyond detection. Newton had real grounds for claiming in a letter to Halley in June 1686 a “right” to the ellipse, remarking that “Kepler knew the Orb to be not circular but oval, and guest it to be Elliptical” [C, II, 436]. Entirely independently, the most judicious reader of the first edition of the Principia, Christiaan Huygens, wrote the following summary of the Principia‘s achievement in his notebook upon reading the complimentary copy Newton had sent him:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The famous M. Newton has brushed aside all the difficulties together with the Cartesian vortices; he has shown that the planets are retained in their orbits by their gravitation toward the Sun. And that the excentrics necessarily become elliptical. [OH, XXI, 143]\r\nSo, all three of Kepler''s rules that came to be called “laws” after the Principia were known to be nothing more than holding to high approximation when Newton started on the project in 1684. And the leading issue in orbital astronomy at the time was not why Kepler''s rules hold, but rather which, if any, of the comparably accurate different approaches to calculating orbits was to be preferred.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The distinct possibility of the ellipse being only an approximation to the true trajectory explains the appropriateness of the question Hooke put to Newton in 1679 and Halley put to him again in 1684 — what trajectory does a body describe when moving under an inverse-square force directed toward a central body? The inverse-square part of this question came from combining the mathematical theory of uniform circular motion, which Huygens had published in his Horologium Oscillatorium of 1673, with Kepler''s 3/2 power rule: the force in a string retaining a body in a uniform circular orbit varies directly as the radius of the circle and inversely as the square of the period; but the squares of the periods of the planets vary as the cubes of their mean distances; and hence, at least to a first approximation, the forces retaining the planets in their orbits vary inversely with the square of the radii of their nearly circular orbits. But now allow the distance of the orbiting body from the center to vary rather than remaining constant, as in a circle. What trajectory would result if the force toward the center varies as the inverse-square of the distance from the center toward which the force is always directed? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The answer in the nine page tract “De Motu Corporum in Gyrum” that Newton sent to Halley in November 1684 is, an ellipse, provided the velocity is not too high (and if it is, then instead a parabola or a hyperbola, depending on the velocity). The key step in developing this answer is a generalization of uniform circular motion to the case of motion under a “centripetal” force — a term Newton coined from Huygens''s “centrifugal” force, by which he meant the tension in the string keeping the body in a circle; and a key to this step was the discovery that a body moving under any form of centripetal force always sweeps out equal areas in equal times with respect to that center, so that the appropriate geometrical representation of time for generalizing uniform circular motion is area swept out rather than angle or arc length. The tract also confirms that Kepler''s 3/2 power rule continues to hold for bodies orbiting in confocal ellipses governed by inverse-square centripetal forces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These were remarkable steps forward at the time, but they and the questions behind them form only an initial part of the context in which Newton went on to write the Principia. Shortly after the “De Motu” tract went off to London, Newton revised the tract and added two further passages. The question precipitating this revision appears to have been about the effect the inverse-square centripetal forces directed toward Jupiter, as implied by its satellites, have on the Sun. Newton first added two principles that he first called “hypotheses” and then changed to “laws”:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Law 3: The relative motions of bodies enclosed in a given space are the same whether that space is at rest or moves perpetually and uniformly in a straight line without circular motion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Law 4: The common center of gravity does not alter its state of motion or rest through the mutual actions of bodies. [U, 267]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second of the two added passages concerns motion in resisting media; it provides a context in which to read Book 2 of the Principia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first added passage, which has become known as the “Copernican scholium,” we here quote in full because it, better than anything else, explains what led Newton into the further research that turned the nine-page tract into the five hundred page Principia. It occurs as a single long paragraph, but is here broken into three segments in order to facilitate commenting on it:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the whole space of the planetary heavens is either at rest (as is commonly believed) or uniformly moved in a straight line, and similarly the common centre of gravity of the planets (by Law 4) is either at rest or is moved at the same time. In either case the motions of the planets among themselves (by Law 3) take place in the same manner and their common centre of gravity is at rest with respect to the whole space, and so it ought to be considered the immobile center of the whole planetary system. Thence indeed the Copernican system is proved a priori. For if a common centre of gravity is computed for any position of the planets, this either lies in the body of the Sun or will always be very near it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By reason of this deviation of the Sun from the center of gravity the centripetal force does not always tend to that immobile center, and hence the planets neither move exactly in ellipses nor revolve twice in the same orbit. Each time a planet revolves it traces a fresh orbit, as happens also with the motion of the Moon, and each orbit depends upon the combined motions of all the planets, not to mention their actions upon each other. Unless I am much mistaken, it would exceed the force of human wit to consider so many causes of motion at the same time, and to define the motions by exact laws which would allow of an easy calculation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leaving aside these fine points, the simple orbit that is the mean between all vagaries will be the ellipse that I have discussed already. If any one shall attempt to determine this ellipse by trigonometrical computation from three observations (as is usual) he will be proceeding without due caution. For these observations will share in the very small irregular motions here neglected and so cause the ellipse to deviate somewhat from its actual magnitude and position (which ought to be the mean among all errors), and so there will be as many ellipses differing from each other as there are trios of observations employed. Very many observations must therefore be joined together and assigned to a single operation which mutually moderate each other and display the mean ellipse both as regards position and magnitude. [U, 280]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first segment highlights a further component of the historical context in which the Principia was written and read. Galileo''s discovery of the phases of Venus in 1613 had provided decisive evidence against the Ptolemaic system,[6] but it could not provide grounds favoring the Copernican over the Tychonic system. In the latter, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn circumnavigate the Sun, and the Sun circumnavigates the Earth, with the consequence that these seven bodies are at all times in the same position in relation to one another as they are in the Copernican system. Whether any decisive empirical grounds could be found favoring the Copernican over the Tychonic system became one of the most celebrated issues of the seventeenth century. Kepler, Galileo, and Descartes all published major books in the first half of the century purporting to resolve this issue,[7] </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kepler and Descartes basing their arguments on the physical mechanism each had proposed as governing the orbital motion. Nevertheless, the leading observational astronomer of the second half of the century, G. D. Cassini, was a Tychonist. In the first segment of the “Copernican Scholium” Newton identifies the center of gravity of the planetary system as the appropriate point to which all the motion should be referred — the technical issue behind the issue over the two systems — and then announces that the centripetal forces identified in the text of “De Motu” as governing the orbital motion open the way to establishing a slightly qualified form of the Copernican system.[8] Newton''s discovery of this line of reasoning was surely a major factor urging him on to the Principia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second segment of the “Copernican Scholium” addresses an issue in orbital astronomy that forms a still further component in the historical context of the Principia. Separate from the question whether Kepler''s or some other approach was to be preferred was the question whether the true motions are significantly more irregular and complicated than the calculated motions in any of these approaches. The complexity of the lunar orbit and the continuing failure to describe it within the accuracy Kepler had achieved for the planets was one consideration lying behind this question. Another came from Kepler''s own finding, noted in the Preface to his Rudolphine Tables[9] and subsequently supported by others, that the true motions may involve further vagaries, as evidenced by apparent changes in the values of orbital elements over time. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important consideration behind this question, however, came from Descartes'' claim that, in keeping with the changing motions of his vortices over long periods of time, the orbits are not mathematically perfect and “they are continuously changed by the passing of the ages” [D, 3, 34]. In the second segment of the quoted Scholium, Newton concludes that, in contrast to the ellipse that answered the mathematical question put to him by Hooke and Halley, the true orbits are not ellipses, but are indeed indefinitely complex. This conclusion is nowhere so forcefully stated in the published Principia, but knowledgeable readers nonetheless saw the work as answering the question whether the true motions are mathematically perfect in the negative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the second and third segments together not only point out that Keplerian motion is only an approximation to the true motions, but they call attention to the potential pitfalls in using the orbits published by Kepler and others as evidence for claims about the planetary system. For example, if the true motions are so complicated, then it is not surprising that all the different calculational approaches were achieving comparable accuracy, for all of them at best hold only approximately. Equally, the success in calculating the orbits could not serve as a basis to argue against Cartesian vortices, for the irregularities entailed by them could not simply be dismissed. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The spectre raised was the very one Newton had objected to during the controversy over his earlier light and color papers: too many hypotheses could be made to fit the same data.[10] Worse, the multiplicity of tenable hypotheses was a spectre haunting mathematical astronomy as a discipline from the end of the sixteenth century forward.[11] So, the conclusion that calculated orbits can at most be mere approximations would have been seen as raising the possibility that truth and exactness were beyond the reach of mathematical astronomy. The main reason why the Principia includes so much beyond the “De Motu” tract is Newton''s endeavor to reach conclusions that had claim to being exact and true in spite of the inordinate complexities of the actual motions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The historical context in which Newton wrote the Principia involved a set of issues that readers of the first edition saw it as addressing: Was Kepler''s approach to calculating the orbits, or some other, to be preferred? Was there some empirical basis for resolving the issue of the Copernican versus the Tychonic system? Were the true motions complicated and irregular versus the calculated motions? Can mathematical astronomy be an exact science? No reader of the Principia at the time had the benefit of seeing how Newton had these questions tied together in the “Copernican Scholium” because it did not appear in print until two hundred years later.[12] Nothing, however, brings out more clearly the extent to which the expanded scope of the Principia stemmed from Newton''s preoccupation with the problem of reaching conclusions that had claim to being exact from evidence that, by his reckoning, held at best to high approximation. This is why the “Copernican scholium” provides the most illuminating context for reading the Principia. Equally, its being unknown for so long helps to explain why the Principia has generally been read so simplistically.</p>\r\n', 2, '2018-12-13 20:05:29'),
(7, 'Newton Principia - Part 3', 'What goes around comes around', '<h3>The Three Editions of the Principia</h3>\r\n<p>Newton originally planned a two-book work, with the first book consisting of propositions mathematically derived from the laws of motion, including a handful concerning motion under resistance forces, and the second book, written and even formatted in the manner of Descartes''s Principia, applying these propositions to lay out the system of the world. By the middle of 1686 Newton had switched to a three-book structure, with the second book devoted to motion in resisting media. What appears to have convinced him that this topic required a separate book was the promise of pendulum-decay experiments to allow him to measure the variation of resistance forces with velocity.[14] When Hooke raised a priority issue on inverse-square forces, Newton dropped the original version of the last book, switching to presenting the system of the world in a sequence of mathematically argued propositions, many of which demand far more of the reader than anything in the original version. The original “System of the World” did appear in print the year after Newton died. No complete text for the original version of Book 1 has ever been found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newton was disappointed in the critical response to the first edition. The response in England was adulatory, but the failure to note loose ends must have led Newton to doubt how much anyone had mastered technical details. The leading scientific figure on the Continent, Christiaan Huygens, offered a mixed response to the book in his Discourse on the Cause of Gravity (1690). On the one hand, he was convinced by Newton''s argument that inverse-square terrestrial gravity not only extends to the Moon, but is one in kind with the centripetal force holding the planets in orbit; on the other hand,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am not especially in agreement with a Principle that he supposes in this calculation and others, namely, that all the small parts that we can imagine in two or more different bodies attract one another or tend to approach each other mutually. This I could not concede, because I believe I see clearly that the cause of such an attraction is not explicable either by any principle of Mechanics or by the laws of motion. Nor am I at all persuaded of the necessity of the mutual attraction of whole bodies, having shown that, were there no Earth, bodies would not cease to tend toward a center because of what we call their gravity. [HD, p.159]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Others on the Continent pressed this complaint even more forcefully. The response that may well have bothered Newton most was the review in Journal des Sçavants:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The work of M. Newton is a mechanics, the most perfect that one could imagine, as it is not possible to make demonstrations more precise or more exact than those he gives in the first two books…. But one has to confess that one cannot regard these demonstrations otherwise than as only mechanical; indeed the author recognizes himself at the end of page four and the beginning of page five that he has not considered their Principles as a Physicist, but as a mere Geometer….</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to make an opus as perfect as possible, M. Newton has only to give us a Physics as exact as his Mechanics. He will give it when he substitutes true motions for those that he has supposed.[15]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Complicating the matter further was the publication in 1689 of Leibniz''s “Essay on the causes of celestial motions,” which offered a vortex theory in which “a planet moves with a double motion composed of the harmonic circulation of its fluid deferent orb, and the paracentric motion, as if it had a certain gravity of attraction, namely an impulsion towards the Sun” [L, 132].[16] Leibniz further concluded that when the body “is carried in an ellipse (or another conic section) with a harmonic circulation, and the centre both of attraction and of circulation is at the focus of the ellipse, then the attractions or solicitations of gravity will be directly as the squares of the circulations, or inversely as the squares of the radii or distances from the focus” [L, 137]. So, within a year and a half of the publication of the Principia a competing vortex theory of Keplerian motion had appeared that was consistent with Newton''s conclusion that the centripetal forces in Keplerian motion are inverse-square. This gave Newton reason to sharpen the argument in the Principia against vortices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second edition appeared in 1713, twenty six years after the first. It had five substantive changes of note. First, the structure of the argument for universal gravity at the beginning of Book 3 was made more evident, and the word ‘hypothesis’ was dropped from it. Second, because of disappointment with pendulum-decay experiments and an erroneous claim about the rate a liquid flows vertically through a hole in the bottom of a container, the second half of Section 7 of Book 2 was entirely replaced, ending with new vertical-fall experiments to measure resistance forces versus velocity and a forcefully stated rejection of all vortex theories.[17] Third, the treatment of the variation of surface gravity with latitude (Book 3, Proposition 20) was significantly extended, partly in response to Huygens''s alternative treatment of this variation, but also because of more recent data from near the Equator. Fourth, the treatment of the wobble of the Earth producing the precession of the equinoxes was revised in order to accommodate a much reduced gravitational force of the Moon on the Earth than in the first edition. Fifth, several further examples of comets were added at the end of Book 3, taking advantage of Halley''s efforts on the topic during the intervening years. In addition to these, two changes were made that were more polemical than substantive: Newton added the General Scholium following Book 3 in the second edition, and his editor Roger Cotes provided a long anti-Cartesian (and anti-Leibnizian) Preface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third edition appeared in 1726, thirty nine years after the first. Most changes in it involved either refinements or new data. The most significant revision of substance was to the variation of surface gravity with latitude, where Newton now concluded that the data showed that the Earth has a uniform density. Subsequent editions and translations have been based on the third edition. Of particular note is the edition published by two Jesuits, Le Seur and Jacquier, in 1739-42, for it contains proposition-by-proposition commentary, much of it employing the Leibnizian calculus, that extends to roughly the same length as Newton''s text.</p>', 2, '2018-12-13 20:06:00'),
(8, 'Newton Principia - Part 4', 'What goes up must come down, spinning wheel goes round and round', '<h3>Definitions and absolute space, time, and motion</h3>\r\n<p>The Principia opens with a section called “Definitions” that includes Newton''s discussion of absolute space, time, and motion. No part of the Principia has received more discussion by philosophers over the three centuries since it was published. Unfortunately, however, a tendency not to pay close attention to the text has caused much of this discussion to produce unnecessary confusion.[18]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The definitions inform the reader of how key technical terms, all of them designating quantities, are going to be used throughout the Principia. In the process Newton introduces terms that have remained a part of physics ever since, such as mass, inertia, and centripetal force. The emphasis in every one of the definitions is on how the designated quantity is to be measured, as illustrated by the opening definition: “Quantity of matter [or mass] is a measure of matter that arises from its density and volume jointly.” (Because a primary measure of density was then specific gravity, no circularity arises here.) Newton distinguishes among three ways of quantifying centripetal forces: the absolute quantity, which corresponds to what we would call the field strength of a central force field; the accelerative quantity, which “is the measure of this force that is proportional to the acceleration generated in a given time;” and the motive quantity, which is the measure of the force proportional to what we would call the change in linear momentum in a given time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to recognize that, in calling the referents of the defined terms “quantities,” Newton is assigning them to the ontological category of quantity in Aristotle''s sense. Thus force and motion are quantities that have direction as well as magnitude, and it makes no sense to talk of forces as individuated entities or substances. Newton''s laws of motion and the propositions derived from them involve relations among quantities, not among objects. In place of “no entity without identity,” we have “no quantity without definite proportions;”[19] and the demand on measurement is to supply values that unequivocally yield an adequate approximation to these definite proportions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immediately following the eight definitions is a Scholium on space, time, and motion. One source of confusion in the literature on this scholium is not paying attention to the primary distinction Newton is drawing, which is between “absolute, true, mathematical” motion versus “relative, apparent, common” motion. The naive distinction between true and apparent motion was, of course, entirely commonplace. Moreover, Newton is scarcely introducing it into astronomy. Ptolemy''s principal innovation in orbital astronomy — the so-called bi-section of eccentricity — entailed that half of the observed first inequality in the motion of the planets arises from a true variation in speed, and half from an only apparent variation associated with the observer being off center. Similarly, Copernicus''s main point was that the second inequality — that is, the observed retrograde motions of the planets — involved not true, but only apparent motions. And the subsequent issue between the Copernican and Tychonic system concerned whether the observed annual motion of the Sun through the zodiac is a true or only an apparent motion of the Sun. So, what Newton is doing in the scholium on space and time is not to introduce a new distinction, but to explicate with more care a distinction that had been fundamental to astronomy for centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The distinctions between “absolute, true, and mathematical” and “relative, apparent, and common” time and space are the conceptual basis Newton employs in laying out the corresponding distinction for motion. He says, “relative, apparent, and common time is any sensible and external measure (precise or imprecise) of duration by motion,” adding a parallel point about absolute space. He points out that the distinction between absolute and relative time has long been part of astronomy insofar as astronomers have long introduced corrections (via the equation of time) to the natural day “in order to measure celestial motions on the basis of a truer time,” and he raises the possibility of there being “no uniform motion by which time may have an exact measure.” Absolute motion is defined as change from one place in absolute space to another. “But since these parts of space cannot be seen and cannot be distinguished from one another by our senses, we use sensible measures in their stead,” adding “it is possible that there is no body truly at rest to which places and motions may be referred” [P, 410]. In short, both absolute time and absolute location are quantities that cannot themselves be observed, but instead have to be inferred from measures of relative time and location, and these measures are always only provisional; that is, they are always open to the possibility of being replaced by some new (still relative) measure that is deemed to be better behaved across a variety of phenomena in parallel with the way in which sidereal time was deemed to be preferable to solar time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notice here the expressed concern with measuring absolute, true, mathematical time, space, and motion, all of which are identified at the beginning of the scholium as quantities. The scholium that follows the eight definitions thus continues their concern with measures that will enable values to be assigned to the quantities in question. Newton expressly acknowledges that these measures are what we would now call theory-mediated and provisional. Measurement is at the very heart of the Principia. It pervades the definitions and scholium on space and time precisely because the primary point of this section is to spell out (in Howard Stein''s words) “the empirical content of a set of theoretical notions” [Stein, 1967, 281].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Accordingly, while Newton''s distinctions between absolute and relative time and space provide a conceptual basis for his explicating his distinction between absolute and relative motion, absolute time and space cannot enter directly into empirical reasoning insofar as they are not themselves empirically accessible. In other words, the Principia presupposes absolute time and space for purposes of conceptualizing the aim of measurement, but the measurements themselves are always of relative time and space, and the preferred measures are those deemed to be providing the best approximations to the absolute quantities. Newton never presupposes absolute time and space in his empirical reasoning. Motion in the planetary system is referred to the fixed stars, which are provisionally being taken as an appropriate reference for measurement, and sidereal time is provisionally taken as the preferred approximation to absolute time. Moreover, in the corollaries to the laws of motion Newton specifically renounces the need to worry about absolute versus relative motion in two cases:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Corollary 5. When bodies are enclosed in a given space, their motions in relation to one another are the same whether the space is at rest or whether it is moving uniformly straight forward without circular motion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Corollary 6. If bodies are moving in any way whatsoever with respect to one another and are urged by equal accelerative forces along parallel lines, they will all continue to move with respect to one another in the same way as they would if they were not acted on by those forces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, while the Principia presupposes absolute time and space for purposes of conceptualizing absolute motion, the presuppositions underlying all the empirical reasoning about actual motions are philosophically more modest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If absolute time and space cannot serve to distinguish absolute from relative motions — more precisely, absolute from relative changes of motion — empirically, then what can? Newton answers, “The causes which distinguish true motions from relative motions are the forces impressed upon bodies to generate motion. True motion is neither generated nor changed except by forces impressed upon the moving body itself.” The problem then becomes one of distinguishing the forces impressed on bodies, where forces are quantities; and hence the key issue is whether there are theory-mediated measures of them that yield unequivocal values — in contrast to different measures of the same force that yield different values, the hallmark of relative motion. The famous bucket example that follows is offered as illustrating how forces can be distinguished that will then distinguish between true and apparent motion. The final paragraph of the scholium begins and ends as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is certainly very difficult to find out the true motions of individual bodies and actually to differentiate them from apparent motions, because the parts of that immovable space in which the bodies truly move make no impression on the senses. But the situation is not utterly hopeless…. But in what follows, a fuller explanation will be given of how to determine true motions from their causes, effects, and apparent differences, and, conversely, of how to determine from motions, whether true or apparent, their causes and effects. For this was the purpose for which I composed the following treatise. [P, 414f]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does follow are two books of propositions that provide means for inferring forces from motions and motions from forces and a final book that illustrates how these propositions can be applied to the system of the world first to identify the forces governing motion in our planetary system and then to use them to differentiate between certain true and apparent motions of particular interest. In this respect, the empirical content of the theoretical concepts that Newton has explicated in the section called “Definitions” is inextricably linked with the physical theory presented in the rest of the Principia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The contention that the empirical reasoning in the Principia does not presuppose an unbridled form of absolute time and space should not be taken as suggesting that Newton''s theory is free of fundamental assumptions about time and space that have subsequently proved to be problematic. For example, in the case of space, Newton presupposes that the geometric structure governing which lines are parallel and what the distances are between two points is three-dimensional and Euclidean. In the case of time Newton presupposes that, with suitable corrections for such factors as the speed of light, questions about whether two celestial events happened at the same time can in principle always have a definite answer. And the appeal to forces to distinguish real from apparent non-inertial motions presupposes that free-fall under gravity can always, at least in principle, be distinguished from inertial motion.[20]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equally, the contention that the empirical reasoning in the Principia does not presuppose an unbridled form of absolute space should not be taken as denying that Newton invoked absolute space as his means for conceptualizing true deviations from inertial motion. Corollary 5 to the Laws of Motion, quoted above, put him in a position to introduce the notion of an inertial frame, but he did not do so, perhaps in part because Corollary 6 showed that even using an inertial frame to define deviations from inertial motion would not suffice. Empirically, nevertheless, the Principia follows astronomical practice in treating celestial motions relative to the fixed stars, and one of its key empirical conclusions (Book 3, Prop. 14, Corol. 1) is that the fixed stars are at rest with respect to the center of gravity of our planetary system.</p>', 2, '2018-12-13 20:06:38'),
(9, 'Newton Principia - Part 5', 'The Big Fig Newton', '<h3>Newton''s Laws of Motion</h3>\r\n<p>The designation “laws of motion” had been used in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in the late 1660s for principles governing motion under impact put forward by Christopher Wren, John Wallis, and Christiaan Huygens. Only the first of the three laws Newton gives in the Principia corresponds to any of these principles, and even the statement of it is distinctly different: Every body perseveres in its state of being at rest or of moving uniformly straight forward except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by forces impressed. This general principle, which following the lead of Newton came to be called the principle or law of inertia, had been in print since Pierre Gassendi''s De motu impresso a motore translato of 1641. Newton probably first encountered it in print when he read Descartes'' Principia, where it is comprised by his first two “laws of nature” and is used immediately to assert “that any body which is moving in a circle constantly tends to move away from the center of the circle which it is describing.” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the basis for Descartes concluding that some form of unseen matter (namely the vortices) must be in contact with the planets, for otherwise they would go off in a straight line. It is the first of the three hypotheses from which Huygens develops his theory of “falling heavy bodies and their motion in a cycloid” in his Horologium Oscillatorium of 1673: If there were no gravity, and if the air did not impede the motion of bodies, then any body will continue its given motion with uniform velocity in a straight line. Newton had adopted it as a “hypothesis” in the registered version of “De Motu,” though stated without reference to impressed forces: Every body under the sole action of its innate force moves uniformly in a straight line indefinitely unless something extraneous hinders it. The striking difference in the formulation in the Principia versus the one in “De Motu” — and, for that matter, versus all earlier formulations in print — is the reference to impressed forces. In all earlier formulations, any departure from uniform motion in a straight line implied the existence of a material impediment to the motion; in the more abstract formulation in the Principia, the existence of an impressed force is implied, with the question of how this force is effected left open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The modern F=ma form of Newton''s second law nowhere occurs in any edition of the Principia even though he had seen his second law formulated in this way in print during the interval between the second and third editions in Jacob Hermann''s Phoronomia of 1716. Instead, it has the following formulation in all three editions: A change in motion is proportional to the motive force impressed and takes place along the straight line in which that force is impressed. In the body of the Principia this law is applied both to discrete cases, in which an instantaneous impulse such as from impact is effecting the change in motion, and to continuously acting cases, such as the change in motion in the continuous deceleration of a body moving in a resisting medium. Newton thus appears to have intended his second law to be neutral between discrete forces (that is, what we now call impulses) and continuous forces. (His stating the law in terms of proportions rather than equality bypasses what seems to us an inconsistency of units in treating the law as neutral between these two.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The obvious question with the second law is what Newton means by “a change in motion.” If he had meant a change in what we call momentum — that is, if he had meant, in modern notation, ?mv — the proper phrasing would have been “a change in the quantity of motion.” In a passage composed in the early 1690s when Newton was intending to restructure the Principia, he explained what he meant:</p>', 2, '2018-12-13 20:07:08'),
(10, 'Learning Chinese in Mainland China vs. Taiwan', 'Which is better -- does it even matter?', '<h3>Is it better to learn Mandarin from a Chinese or Taiwanese teacher?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I lived in both Taiwan and Mainland China, and studied Mandarin in both places. I can say to you unequivocally that you definitely want to learn to speak Mandarin in Mainland China, or at least from a native speaker from Dalu (The Mainland). However, when it comes to leaning to read and write Chinese, it is wonderfully beneficial if you can at least lay down your foundation in Taiwan. So, Mainland is better for learning speaking (and listening), while Taiwan, at least to start, has the advantage for gaining literacy. Why is this? I shall explain</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why you need to learn to speak Mandarin from a native speaker from Mainland China ?Mainland China — the closer to Beijing the better — is home to the Mandarin accent (kouyin ??), which is considered standard (biaozhen ??). There are certain sounds, particularly those involving tongue curls, that are very difficult for many Taiwanese, for whom, after all, Mandarin is a second language.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Mandarin Chinese is NOT the native language of the Taiwanese</h3>?<p>The native language of the people of Taiwan is—surprise, surprise—Taiwanese! It therefore makes about as much sense to learn Mandarin Chinese in Taiwan, as it would to learn English in, say, India, where English is widely-spoken, but as a second language.\r\nMandarin Sounds that Taiwanese struggle with?Mandarin has several distinctive tongue-curl sounds, consonant blends to us, which involve ch, sh, and zhi sounds. These are all but beyond the ability of many Taiwanese speakers to faithfully reproduce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking Chinese lessons in Taiwan— which I did — is kind of like learning English from someone who pronounces shell as sell, sheet as seat, etc.\r\nUpside to learning to READ and WRITE Chinese in Taiwan: Traditional Characters?Despite the issue with the accent — which is pretty severe — I did enjoy an unintended benefit of spending my first year of Chinese study in Taiwan: I got to learn traditional characters! I made slow progress learning to speak Chinese, because I set out from the get-go to learn how to read and write everything I could say. It wasn’t enough to learn how to say Ni hao ma ???, but I had to learn how to read and write it, as well. Now, when the Chinese Communist Party came to power in 1949, they soon undertook an ambitious program of debatable merit to simplify the written language. Thousands of characters were whittled down. Dragon for example (long) was reduced from 17 strokes to just five:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jiantizi ??? (simplified) vs. Fantizi ??? (traditional) characters?Taiwan never adopted this simplified system, known as jiantizi ???. There, as well as in Hong Kong and the overseas Chinese communities, such as New York City’s Chinatown, newspapers, shop signs and advertisements are still in traditional characters, or ??? fantizi. And of course, older works and artistic inscriptions, poems and the like are written in fantizi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The simplification process was oftentimes overdone. For example, in the above dragon example, the radicals, or building blocks, of the original version were essentially lost. Many of the simplified characters were stripped of their uniqueness, making them, ironically enough, harder to memorize, despite the reduction in strokes that was supposed to make them easier to learn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I moved to Beijing several years after leaving Taiwan, I greatly appreciated having had laid a foundation in traditional characters. As far as I was concerned, the many foreigners in China who knew only simplified characters had a bit of a hole in their knowledge of the written language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few commenters have pointed out that Taiwanese is not in fact the first language of the Taiwanese people. The language is Hakka. My mistake on this stems from my time in Taiwan, where I taught English in Tainan. The foreigners there all referred to the non-Mandarin language spoken there as Taiwanese, as in: “I thought about trying to learn Taiwanese, too, but I think I’ll just stick to Mandarin” or “My girlfriend’s family switches to Taiwanese when they don’t want me to understand what they are talking about.”\r\nBeijing accent & Mandarin tongue curl sounds: NOT one and the same.</p>\r\n ?<p>The tongue-curl sound is not peculiar to Beijingers, as one commenter suggested. It’s just standard Mandarin, without which one can barely be understood. Rather than saying Zhi shi shenma (What is this?) .. </p>\r\n?<p>If you dropped the tongue curl you would get the pronunciation that I experienced while living in Taiwan: Zi si semma.</p>\r\n?<p>The chart below demonstrates the tongue curl. That, along with proper tone usage, are two of the main challenges of mastering spoken Mandarin Chinese:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Come to Beijing! I’ll put a yangrou chua’rrrrr on the barbie for you!</p>?\r\n<p>Now that we know what the Beijing accent is NOT, what IS the Beijing accent, anyway? Yes, it is an over-exaggeration of the tongue-curl sounds, however since those are standard Mandarin to begin with, there must be more to the Beijing accent than just overdoing it on the biaozhen (standard) sounds. Indeed, there is. The best example of what is sometimes referred to as the “Beijing brogue” that I can think of is the dropping or N sounds at the end of a word, and replacing them with a long, drawn out R:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>STANDARD MANDARIN vs. BEIJING ACCENT: </p>\r\n?<p>Gongyuan ?? (garden) is Gongyua’r in Beijing accent (gongyua’rrr)</p>\r\n?<p>Yangrou chuan ??? (lamb kabob) is Yangrou chua’rrr in Bejing.</p>\r\n?\r\n\r\n', 1, '2018-12-13 20:08:12');

(11, 'Should I still bother to learn jQuery?', 'What is jQuery, anyway?', '<h3>Why is jQuery on the way out?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>jQuery is in decline because its role in supercharging frontend development and interacting with the backend via AJAX calls is being nibbled away at by the rise of frontend frameworks React, Angular and Vue, and by more of jQuery’s cool features being available natively in HTML5 and CSS3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trends in jobs with jQuery vs. React as a keyword and Git pull requests are just two of the metrics that document the rise of React at the expense of jQuery. In fact, those two trend lines crossed like an X around a year ago.\r\nWe still teach jQuery at my school, Code Immersives, but in over 45 weeks (900 hours of total instruction), we spend one week on jQuery. Meanwhile, React and the whole MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js) have several full courses — covering hundreds of hours of instruction and labs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>UPDATE</h3>?<p>This post has been sent to literally millions of smart, savvy developers like yourself, so I feel kinda compelled to elaborate upon a few points. I received a number of comments that correctly note that jQuery is still used by millions of websites and developers.\r\nOther comments have said that Angular and React are not good for SEO, since with a Virtual DOM the Google spiders don’t have a rendered page to read when they come a ‘crawlin’. On this point, I would like to quote an Oct 2015 Google webmaster blog:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, as long as you’re not blocking Googlebot from crawling your JavaScript or CSS files, we are generally able to render and understand your web pages like modern browsers. To reflect this improvement, we recently updated our technical Webmaster Guidelines to recommend against disallowing Googlebot from crawling your site’s CSS or JS files.\r\nThe point being made here is that the Google bot is smart enough to look at code and figure out how pages made out of the thin air of a Virtual DOM would look in the browser, fully rendered. This is on a par with what the browser has to do, that is, take code and render it. If Google’s Chrome browser can do it, so can Google’s search engine spider.\r\njQuery is still used by millions of websites and is still worth learning?There is no question jQuery is still very widely used. I would encourage anyone who is serious about learning Javascript to add jQuery to their toolkit. Just don’t stop there—go on to learn one of the Big Three frontend frameworks: Angular, React or Vue.\r\nWith jQuery, my best advice is don’t skip jQuery altogether, but don’t so much as look at it before you first have a strong foundation in Vanilla Javascript. If you already have decent JS chops, it doesn’t take that long to get competent with jQuery, which is still just Javascript.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When learning jQuery, try to also do a Vanilla Javascript version ?During the limited amount of time we do spend on jQuery, I have my students try to implement Vanilla JS versions of whatever we are learning to do with jQuery: Here’s the jQuery animate() method. How can we do this with Vanilla JS (hint: setInterval).\r\nMore reasons jQuery is likely in decline?Here are a yet a few more pennies to add to my original two cents:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>jQueryesque functionality increasingly available without a plugin</h3>\r\n?<p>Some of the “selling points” of jQuery have become less compelling over the years, as more and more cool stuff can now be done natively in HTML5 and CSS3:\r\nDOM selectors in HTML5 (targeting HTML elements w JS). Back around 2010 or so, the HTML-JS DOM selectors were a tad restrictive (getElementById, getElementsByTagName, etc), since you could not target by class name or by nested element. In that context, jQuery was prized for providing an easy way to access specific DOM nodes, such as elements that used a particular CSS class nested within a certain HTML element. But then along came HTML5 with querySelector and just like that, you didn’t need a plugin to target nested DOM elements with pin-point precision using compound selectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Animation in CSS3</h3>?<p>jQuery makes it easy to animate elements, such as having divs go sliding across the page. With the demise of Flash, beginning around 2011, all those cool slideshows and sliding panel navigations that used to be SWF files had to be re-done, with jQuery being the go-to solution. But then along came CSS3, with its animation capabilities. It took browsers a while to support the fancy features, but by now CSS3 has really muscled in on jQuery’s animation turf, which jQuery in turn had ruthlessly usurped from Flash. Karma’s a humdinger, I guess. Anyway, nowadays there’s less urgent need for a plugin to make elements move, scale or fade on a web page. You can do most of that stuff with CSS3.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Bad implementation gives jQuery a bum rap</h3>?<p>There are a lot of bad, bloated implementations of jQuery widgets out there in the wild, which have perhaps unfairly cast the library itself in a bad light. Believer it or not, there are some wannabe web devs who skip learning Vanilla JS and jump straight into jQuery. The upside is that, sure, they get instant gratification: Ta-dah! Slideshow! But the downside is that they make the user load like 50 MB of images just to visit the home page. A skilled dev would know to load only the first few images, then load the rest dynamically, as requested. Howevah… revamping a jQuery widget so that it can make asynchronous calls on the backend using AJAX-JSON and/or PHP-MySQL or what have you, requires considerable programming skill. It’s not jQuery’s fault if a lot of its projects are botched and butchered, but it gets the blame, anyway. But then, where is it writ that life is fair?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Too many Aging, Unresponsive jQuery Widgets still in use</h3>\r\n<p>Lastly — and this is just a hypothesis — too many aging widgets in the wild may be turning people off, thus expediting jQuery’s decline. Many a long-in-the-tooth jQuery slideshow was not designed with mobile-friendliness in mind. If the widget dates from before, say, 2012, odds are that it looks the same on your phone as on your phablet as on your laptop, which is not good. There are a lot of newer, responsive widgets, mind you, but you gotta pick ‘n’ choose with care.</p>\r\n', 1, '2018-12-13 20:08:57'),

How many a poor immortal soul have\r\nI met well-nigh crushed and smothered under its load,\r\ncreeping down the road of life, pushing before it a barn\r\nseventy-five feet by forty, its Augean stables never\r\ncleansed, and one hundred acres of land, tillage, mowing,\r\npasture, and wood-lot! The portionless, who struggle\r\nwith no such unnecessary inherited encumbrances,\r\nfind it labor enough to subdue and cultivate a few cubic\r\nfeet of flesh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But men labor under a mistake. The better part of the\r\nman is soon plowed into the soil for compost. By a\r\nseeming fate, commonly called necessity, they are employed,\r\nas it says in an old book, laying up treasures\r\nwhich moth and rust will corrupt and thieves break\r\nthrough and steal . It is a fool''s life, is they will find\r\nwhen they get to the end of it, if not before . It is said\r\nthat Deucalion and Pyrrha created men by throwing\r\nstones over their heads behind them : -\r\nInde genus durum sumus, experiensque laborum,\r\nEt documenta dames qua simus origine nati .\r\nOr, as Raleigh rhymes it in his sonorous way, -\r\n"From thence our kind hard-hearted is, enduring pain and care,\r\nApproving that our bodies of a stony nature are ."\r\nSo much for a blind obedience to a blundering oracle,\r\nthrowing the stones over their heads behind them, and\r\nnot seeing where they fell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most men, even in this comparatively free country,\r\nthrotwh mere igmoranee and mistake, are so occupied\r\nwith the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors\r\nof life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them.\r\nTheir fingers, from excessive toil, are too clumsy and\r\nt.remblc too much for that. Actually, the laboring man\r\nhas not leisure for a true integrity day by day ; he cannot\r\nAfcird to sustain the manliest. relations to men ; his\r\nlabor wonld he depreciated in the market. He has no\r\ntime t+) b(~ ~ir~athing btrt a machine . How can he renwcnber\r\nwell leis ignorance -- which his growth requires - -\r\nwho has so often to use his knowledge? We should feed\r\nand clothe him gratuitously sometimes, and recruit him\r\nwith our cordials, before we judge of him . The finest\r\nqualities of our nature, like the bloom on fruits, can be\r\npreserved only by the most delicate handling. Yet we do\r\nnot treat ourselves nor one another thus tenderly.</p>', 3, '2018-12-13 20:15:06'),
(15, 'Walden Thoreau - Part 2', 'More musings and reflections of stuff', '<p>Some of you, we all know, are poor, find it hard to\r\nlive, are sometimes, as it were, gasping for breath. I\r\nhave no doubt that some of you who read this book are\r\nunable to pay for all the dinners which you have actually\r\neaten, or for the coats and shoes which are fast wearing\r\nor are already worn out, and have come to this page to\r\nspend borrowed or stolen time, robbing your creditors\r\nof an hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is very evident what mean and sneaking\r\nlives many of you live, for my sight has been whetted by\r\nexperience ; always on the limits, trying to get into business\r\nand trying to get out of debt, a very ancient slough,\r\ncalled by the Latins aes alienum, another''s brass, for\r\nsome of their coins were made of brass ; still living, and\r\ndying, and buried by this other''s brass ; always promising\r\nto pay, promising to pay, to-morrow, and dying\r\nto-day, insolvent ; seeking to curry favor, to get custom,\r\nby how many modes, only not state-prison offences ;\r\nlying, flattering, voting, contracting yourselves into a\r\nnutshell of civility, or dilating into an atmosphere of\r\nthin and vaporous generosity, that you may persuade\r\nyour neighbor to let you make his shoes, or his hat, or\r\nhis coat, or his carriage, or import his groceries for\r\nhim ; making yourselves sick, that you may lay up\r\nsomething against a sick day, something to be tucked\r\naway in an old chest, or in a stocking behind the plastering, or, more safely, ill the brick bank; no matter where, no matter liow much or how little.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I sometimes wonder that we can be so frivolous, I\r\nmay almost say, as to attend to the gross but somewhat\r\nforeign form of servitude called Negro Slavery, there are\r\nso many keen and subtle masters that enslave both North\r\nand South. It is hard to have a Southern overseer; it is\r\nworse to have a Northern one ; but worst of all when you\r\nare the slave-driver of yourself . Talk of a divinity in\r\nman! Look at the teamster on the highway, wending to\r\nmarket by day or night; does any divinity stir within\r\nhint? His highest duty to fodder and water his horses!\r\nWhat is his destiny to him compared with the shipping\r\ninterests ? Does not he drive for Squire Make-a-stir ?\r\nIlow godlike, how immortal, is he ? See how he cowers\r\nand sneaks, how vaguely all the clay he fears, not being\r\nimmortal nor divine, but the slave and prisoner of his\r\nown opinion of himself, a fame won by his own deeds.\r\nPublic opinion is a weak tyrant compared with our own\r\nprivate opinion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What a man thinks of himself, that it is\r\nwhich determines, or rather indicates, his fate. Selfentancipatiorr\r\neven in the West Indian provinces of the\r\nfancy and imagination, -what Wilberforce is there to\r\nbring that about ? Think, also, of the ladies of the land\r\nwc~rving toilet cushions against the last day, not to betray\r\ntoo green an interest in their fates! As if you could\r\nIhe mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What\r\nis called resignation is confirmed desperation . From\r\nthe desperate city you go into the desperate country, and\r\nhave to console vourself with the bravery of minks and\r\nmuskrats. A stereotyped but unconscious despair is concealed\r\neven under what are called the ;antes and amusements\r\nof mankind. There is no play in them, for this\r\ncomes after work. But it is a characteristic of wisdom\r\nnot to do desperate things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we consider what, to use the words of the catechism,\r\nis the chief end of man, and what are the true\r\nnecessaries and means of life, it appears as if men had\r\ndeliberately chosen the cornmon mode of living because\r\nthey preferred it to any other. Yet they honestly drink\r\nthere is no choice left . But alert and healthy natures\r\nremember that the sun rose clear. It is never too late\r\nto give up our prejudices. No way of thinking or doing,\r\nhowever ancient, can be trusted without proof. What\r\neverybody echoes or in silence passes by as true to-day\r\nmay turn out to be falsehood to-morrow, more smoke of\r\nopinion, which some had trusted for a cloud that would\r\nsprinkle fertilizing rain on their fields . What old people\r\nsay you cannot do, you try and find that you can. Old\r\ndeeds for old people, and new deeds for new. Old people\r\ndid not know enough once, perchance, to fetch fresh\r\nfuel to keep the fire a-going ; new people put a little dry\r\nwood under a pot, and are whirled round the globe with\r\nthe speed of birds, in a way to kill old people, as the\r\nphrase is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Age is no better, hardly so well, qualified for\r\nan instructor as youth, for it has not profited so much as\r\nit has lost . One may almost doubt if the wisest man has\r\nlearned anything of absolute value by living. Practically,\r\nthe old have no very important advice to give the young,\r\n!heir own experience has been so partial, and their lives\r\nhave been such miserable failures, for private reasons,\r\nas they must believe ; and it may be that they have some\r\nfaith left which belies that experience, and they are only\r\nless young than they were. I have lived some thirty years\r\non this planet, and I have yet to hear the first syllable of\r\nvaluable or even earnest advice from my seniors. They\r\nhave told me nothing, and probably cannot tell me anything\r\nto the purpose. Here is life, an experiment to a\r\ngreat extent untried by me; but it does not avail me that\r\nthey have tried it . If I have any experience which I\r\nthink valuable, I am sure to reflect that this my Mentors\r\nsaid nothing about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One farmer says to me, "You cannot live on vegetable\r\nfood solely, for it furnishes nothing to make bones with ;"\r\nand so he religiously devotes a part of his day to supplying\r\nhis system with the raw material of bones ; walking\r\nall the while he talks behind his oxen, which, with vegetable-made\r\nbones, jerk him and his lumbering plow\r\nalong in spite of every obstacle. Some things are really\r\nnecessaries of life in some circles, the most helpless and\r\ndiseased, which in others are luxuries merely, and in\r\nothers still are entirely unknown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The whole ground of human life seems to some to\r\nhave been gone over by their predecessors, both the\r\nheights and the valleys, and all things to have been cared\r\nfor. According to Evelyn, "the wise Solomon prescribed\r\nordinances for the very distances of trees ; and the Roman\r\npvrtors have decided how often you may go into\r\nyour neighbor''s land to gather the acorns which fall on\r\nit without trespass . and what share belongs to that neighbor."\r\nHippocrates has even left directions how we should\r\ncut our nails ; that is, even with the ends of the fingers,\r\nneither shorter nor longer . Undoubtedly the very tedium\r\nand ennui which presume to have exhausted the variety\r\nand the joys of life are as old as Adam. But man''s capacities\r\nhave never been measured; nor are we to judge\r\nof what he can do by any precedents, so little has been\r\ntried. Whatever have been thy failures hitherto, " be\r\nnot afflicted, my child, for who shall assign to thee what\r\nthou hast left undone?"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We might try our lives by a thousand simple tests ; as,\r\nfor instance, that the same sun which ripens my beans\r\nillumines at once a system of earths like ours. If I had\r\nremembered this it would have prevented some mistakes.\r\nThis was not the light in which I hoed them.\r\nThe stars are the apexes of what wonderful triangles!\r\nWhat distant and different beings in the various mansions\r\nof the universe are contemplating the same one at\r\nthe same moment! Nature and human life are as various\r\nas our several constitutions. Who shall say what prospect\r\nlife offers to another ? Could a greater miracle take\r\nplace than for us to look through each other''s eyes for\r\nan instant? We should live in all the ages of the world\r\nin an hour; ay, in all the worlds of the ages.

We may waive just so much care of ourselves as\r\nwe honest]'' bestow elsewhere. Nature is as well adapted\r\nto our weakness as to our strength. The incessant anxiety\r\nand strain of some is a well-nigh incurable form of\r\ndisease . We are made to exaggerate the importance of\r\nwhat work we do ; and yet how much is not done by us!\r\nor, what if we had been taken sick? How vigilant we\r\nare! determined not to live by faith if we can avoid it ;\r\nall the day long on the alert, at night we unwillingly say\r\nour prayers and commit ourselves to uncertainties.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>So thoroughly and sincerely are we compelled to live, reverencing\r\nour life, and denying the possibility of change .\r\nThis is the only way, we say ; but there are as many\r\nways as there can be drawn radii from one centre. All\r\nchange is a miracle to contemplate ; but it is a miracle\r\nwhich is taking place every instant . Confucius said,\r\nTo know that we know what we know, and that we do\r\nnot what we do not know, that is true knowledge.\r\nWhen one man has reduced a fact of the imagination to\r\nbe a fact to his understanding, I foresee that all men will\r\n,it length establish their lives on that basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let us consider for a moment what most of the trouble\r\nand ansicty ivl,9ich I have referred to is about, and how\r\nmuch it is necessary that we be troubled, or at least careful\r\n. It %vould he some advantage to live a primitive and\r\nfrontier life, though in the midst of an outward civilization,\r\nif only to learn what are the gross necessaries of\r\nlife and what methods have been taken to obtain them ;\r\nor even to look over the old day-books of the merchants,\r\nto see what it was that men most commonly bought at\r\nthe stores, what they stored, that is, what are the grossest\r\ngroceries . For the improvements of ages have had but\r\nlittle influence on the essential laws of man''s existence :\r\nas our skeletons, probably, are not to be distinguished\r\nfrom those of our ancestors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the words, necessary of life, I mean whatever, of\r\nall that man obtains by his own exertions, has been from\r\nthe first, or from long use has become, so important to\r\nhuman life that few, if any, whether from savageness,\r\nor poverty, or philosophy, ever attempt to do without it.\r\nTo many creatures there is in this sense but one necessary\r\nof life, Food. To the bison of the prairie it is a few\r\ninches of palatable grass, with water to drink ; unless\r\nhe seeks the Shelter of the forest or the mountain''s\r\nshadow. None of the brute creation requires more than\r\nFood and Shelter. The necessaries of life for man in this\r\nclimate may, accurately enough, be distributed under\r\nthe several heads of Food, Shelter, Clothing, and Fuel ;\r\nfor not till we have secured these are we prepared to\r\nentertain the true problems of life with freedom and a\r\nprospect of success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Man has invented, not only houses,\r\nbut clothes and cooked food; and possibly from the accidental\r\ndiscovery of the warmth of fire, and the consequent\r\nuse of it, at first a luxury, arose the present necessity\r\nto sit by it. We observe cats and dogs acquiring the\r\nsame second nature. By proper Shelter and Clothing\r\nwe legitimately retain our own internal heat ; but with\r\nan excess of these, or of Fuel, that is, with an external\r\nheat greater than our own internal, may not cookery\r\nproperly be said to begin? Darwin, the naturalist, says\r\nof the inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego, that while his\r\nown party, who were well clothed and sitting close to a\r\nfire, were far from too warm, these naked savages, who\r\nwere farther off, were observed, to his great surprise,\r\n"to be streaming with perspiration at undergoing such\r\na roasting."</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, we are told, the New Hollander goes\r\nnaked with impunity, while the European shivers in his\r\nclothes . Is it impossible to combine the hardiness of\r\nthese savages with the intellectualness of the civilized\r\nman? According to Liebig, man''s body is a stove, and\r\nfood the fuel which keeps up the internal combustion in\r\nthe lungs. In cold weather we eat more, in warm less .\r\nThe animal heat is the result of a slow combustion, and\r\ndisease and death take place when this is too rapid ; or\r\nfor want of fuel, or from some defect in the draught, the\r\nfire goes out . Of course the vital heat is not to be confounded\r\nwith fire ; but so much for analogy . It appears,\r\ntherefore, from the above list, that the expression, animal\r\nlife, is nearly synonymous with the expression, animal\r\nheat; for while Food may be regarded as the Fuel\r\nwhich keeps up the fire within us, - and Fuel serves\r\nonly to prepare that Food or to increase the warmth of\r\nour bodies by addition from without, - Shelter . and\r\nClothing also serve only to retain the heat thus generated\r\nand absorbed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The grand necessity, then, for our bodies, is to keep\r\nwarm, to keep the vital heat in us. What pains we accordingly\r\ntake, not only with our Food, and Clothing,\r\nand Shelter, but with our beds, which are our nightclothes,\r\nrobbing the nests and breasts of birds to prepare this shelter within a shelter, as the mole has its bed of grass and leaves at the end of its burrow! The poor\r\nman is wont to complain that this is a cold world ; and\r\nto cold, no less physical than social, we refer directly a\r\ngreat part of our ails . The summer, in some climates,\r\nmakes possible to man a sort of Elysian life . Fuel, except\r\nto cook his Food, is then unnecessary ; the sun is\r\nhis fire, and many of the fruits are sufficiently cooked by\r\nits rays ; while Food generally is more various, and more\r\neasily obtained, and Clothing and Shelter are wholly or\r\nhalf unnecessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the present day, and in this country,\r\nas I find by my own experience, a few implements, a\r\nknife, an axe, a spade, a wheelbarrow, etc and for the\r\nstudious, lamplight, stationery, and access to a few books,\r\nrank next to necessaries, and can all be obtained at a\r\ntrifling cost. Yet some, not wise, go to the other side of\r\nthe globe, to barbarous and unhealthy regions, and devote\r\nthemselves to trade for ten or twenty years, in order\r\nthat they may live, - that is, keep comfortably warm,\r\n- and die in New England at last. The luxuriously rich\r\nare not simply kept comfortably warm, but unnaturally\r\nhot ; as I implied before, they are cooked, of course\r\na la mode.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts\r\nof life, are not only not indispensable, but positive\r\nhindrances to the elevation of mankind. With respect\r\nto luxuries and comforts, the wisest have ever lived a\r\nmore simple and meagre life than the poor. The ancient\r\nphilosophers, Chinese, Hindoo, Persian, and Greek,\r\nwere a class than which none has been poorer in outward\r\nriches, none so rich in inward. We know not much\r\nabout them . It is remarkable that we know so much of\r\nthem as we do. The same is true of the more modern\r\nreformers and benefactors of their race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None can be an\r\nimpartial or wise observer of human life but from the\r\nvantage ground of what we should call voluntary poverty.\r\nOf a life of luxury the fruit is luxury, whether in\r\nagriculture, or commerce, or literature, or art. There\r\nare nowadays professors of philosophy, but not philosophers.\r\nYet it is admirable to profess because it was once\r\nadmirable to live . To be a philosopher is not merely to\r\nhave subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so\r\nto love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life\r\nof simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust.\r\nIt is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically,\r\nbut practically. The success of great scholars\r\nand thinkers is commonly a courtier-like success, not\r\nkingly, not manly.</p> \r\n', 3, '2018-12-13 20:16:07'),
(17, 'Walden Thoreau - Part 4', 'A slower pace of life', '<p>They make shift to live merely by\r\nconformity, practically as their fathers did, and are in no\r\nsense the progenitors of a nobler race of men. But why\r\ndo men degenerate ever? What makes families run out\r\nWhat is the nature of the luxury which enervates and\r\ndestrovs nations ? Are we sure that there is none of it in\r\nour own lives ? The philosopher is in advance of his age\r\neven in the outward form of his life . He is not fed, sheltered,\r\nclothed, warmed, like his contemporaries . How\r\ncan a man be a philosopher and not maintain his vital\r\nheat l)y better methods than other men ?\r\nW1ten a man is warmed by the several modes which\r\nI have described, what does lie want next?

Why has man rooted himself\r\nthus firmly in the earth, but that he may rise in the\r\nsame proportion into the heavens above ? - for the nobler\r\nplants are valued for the fruit they bear at last in the\r\nair and light, far from the ground, and are not treated\r\nlike the humbler esculents, which, though they may be\r\nbiennials, are cultivated only till they have perfected\r\ntheir root, and often cut down at top for this purpose,\r\nso that most would not know them in their flowering\r\nseason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do not mean to prescribe rules to strong and valiant\r\nnatures, who will mind their own affairs whether in\r\nheaven or hell, and perchance build more magnificently\r\nand spend more lavishly than the richest, without ever\r\nimpoverishing themselves, not knowing how they live,\r\n- if, indeed, there are any such, as has been dreamed;\r\nnor to those who find their encouragement and inspiration\r\nin precisely the present condition of things, and\r\ncherish it with the fondness and enthusiasm of lovers, -\r\nand, to some extent, I reckon myself in this number ; I\r\ndo not speak to those who are well employed, in whatever\r\ncircumstances, and they know whether they are\r\nwell employed or not ; -but mainly to the mass of men\r\nwho are discontented, and idly complaining of the hard-\r\nness of their lot. or of the times, when they might improve\r\nthem. There are some who complain most energetically\r\nand inconsolably o£ any, because they are, as they say,\r\ndoing their duty. I also have in my mind that seemingly\r\nwealthy, but most terribly impoverished class of all, who\r\nhave accumulated dross, but know not how to use it, or\r\nget rid of it, and thus have forged their own golden or\r\nsilver fetters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I should attempt to tell how I have desired to spend\r\nmy life in years past, it would probably surprise those\r\nof my readers who are somewhat acquainted with its\r\nactual history ; it would certainly astonish those who\r\nknow nothing about it . I will only hint at some of the\r\nenterprises which I have cherished. In any weather, at any hour of the day or night, I have been anxious to improve the nick of time, and notch it\r\non my stick too ; to stand on the meeting of two eternities,\r\nthe past and future, which is precisely the present\r\nmoment ; to toe that line . You will pardon some obscurities,\r\nfor there are more secrets in my trade than in\r\nmost men''s, and yet not voluntarily kept, but inseparable\r\nfrom its very nature. I would gladly tell all that\r\nI know about it, and never paint "No Admittance" on\r\nInv gate. I long ago lost a hound, a bay horse, and a turtledove,\r\nand am still on their trail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many are the travellers\r\nI have spoken concerning them, describing their tracks\r\nand what calls they answered to. I have met one or two\r\nwho had heard the hound, and the tramp of the horse,\r\nand even seen the dove disappear behind a, cloud, and\r\nthey seemed as anxious to recover them as if they had\r\nlost them themselves. To anticipate, not the sunrise and the dawn merely, but, if possible, Nature herself! How many mornings,\r\nsummer and winter, before yet any neighbor was stirring\r\nabout his business, have I been about mine! No\r\ndoubt, many of my townsmen have met me returning\r\nfrom this enterprise, farmers starting for Boston in the\r\ntwilight, or woodchoppers going to their work. It is true,\r\nI never assisted the sun materially in his rising, but,\r\ndoubt not, it was of the last importance only to be present\r\nat it. So many autumn, ay, and winter days, spent outside\r\nthe town, trying to hear what was in the wind, to hear\r\nand carry it express! I well-nigh sunk all my capital in\r\nit, and lost my own breath into the bargain, running in\r\nthe face of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it had concerned either of the political\r\nparties, depend upon it, it would have appeared in the\r\nGazette with the earliest intelligence. At other times\r\nwatching from the observatory of some cliff or tree, to\r\ntelegraph any new arrival ; or waiting at evening on the\r\nhill-tops for the slay to fall, that I might catch something,\r\nthough I never caught much, and that, manna-wise,\r\nwould dissolve again in the sun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a long time I was reporter to a journal, of no very\r\nwide circulation, whose editor has never yet seen fit to\r\nprint the bulk of my contributions, and, as is too common\r\nwith writers, I got only my labor for my pains.\r\nHowever, in this case my pains were their own reward.\r\nFor many years I was self-appointed inspector of\r\nsnow-storms and rain-storms, and did my duty faith-fully; surveyor, if not of liil;hways, then of forest paths\r\nand all across-lot routes, keeping them open, and ravines\r\nbridged and passable at all seasons, where the public\r\nheel had testified to their utility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have looked after the wild stock of the town, which\r\ngive a faithful herdsman a good deal of trouble by leaping\r\nfences ; and I have had an eye to the unfrequented\r\nnooks and corners of the farm ; though I did not always\r\nknow whether Jonas or Solomon worked in a particular\r\nfield to-day ; that was none of my business. I have watered\r\nthe red huckleberry, the sand cherry and the nettletree,\r\nthe red pine and the black ash, the white grape and\r\nthe yellow viola, which might have withered else in dry\r\nseasons. In short, I went on thus for a long time (I may say it\r\nwithout boasting), faithfully minding my business, till it\r\nbecame more and more evident that my townsmen would\r\nnot after all admit me into the list of town officers, nor \r\nmake my place a sinecure with a moderate allowance.\r\nDIy accounts, which I can swear to have kept faithfully,\r\nI have, indeed, never got audited, still less accepted, still\r\nless paid and settled. However, I have not set my heart\r\noil that. Not toil since, a strolling Indian went to sell baskets\r\nat the house of a well-known lawyer in my neighborhood.\r\n1)o you wish to buy any baskets?" he asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, we do not want any," was the reply. What! excl1inied\r\nthe Indian as he went out the gate, do you\r\nmean h) starve ing soon liis industrious 1ite\r\nneiglllbon so well off, th~it the lawyer had, to\r\nweave arguments, and, by some magic, wealth and\r\ning followed, -he had said to himself : I will go into\r\nbusiness ; I will weave baskets ; it is a thing which I (, an\r\ndo. Thinking that when be had made the baskets lie\r\nwould have done his part, and then it would be the white\r\nmans to buy them. He had not discovered that it was\r\nnecessary for him to make it worth the others while to\r\nbuy them, or at least make him think that it was so, or\r\nto make something else which it would be worth his\r\nwhile to buy. I too had woven a kind of basket of a delicate\r\ntexture, but I had not made it worth any ones\r\nwhile to buy them. Yet not the less, in my case, did I\r\nthink it worth my while to weave them, and instead of\r\nstudying how to make it worth mens while to buy my\r\nbaskets, I studied rather how to avoid the necessity of\r\nselling them.

(18, 'Forward to 1001 Arabian Nights - Part 1', 'The origin story behind the story', '<p>As regards the transliteration of Arabic words I deliberately reject\r\nthe artful and complicated system, ugly and clumsy withal, affected\r\nby scientific modern Orientalists. Nor is my sympathy with their prime\r\nobject, namely to fit the Roman alphabet for supplanting all others.\r\nThose who learn languages, and many do so, by the eye as well as by\r\nthe ear, well know the advantages of a special character to distinguish,\r\nfor instance, Syriac from Arabic, Gujrati from Marathi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again this Roman\r\nhand bewitched may have its use in purely scientific and literary\r\nworks; but it would be wholly out of place in one whose purpose is\r\nthat of the novel, to amuse rather than to instruct. Moreover the\r\ndevices perplex the simple and teach nothing to the learned. Either the\r\nreader knows Arabic, in which case Greek letters, italics and “upper\r\ncase,” diacritical points and similar typographic oddities are, as a rule\r\nwith some exceptions, unnecessary; or he does not know Arabic, when\r\nnone of these expedients will be of the least use to him. Indeed it is a\r\nmatter of secondary consideration what system we prefer, provided\r\nthat we mostly adhere to one and the same, for the sake of a consistency\r\nwhich saves confusion to the reader.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have especially avoided\r\nthat of Mr. Lane, adopted by Mr. Payne, for special reasons against\r\nwhich it was vain to protest: it represents the debased brogue of Egypt\r\nor rather of Cairo; and such a word as Kemer (ez-Zeman) would be\r\nutterly un-pronounceable to a Badawi. Nor have I followed the practice\r\nof my learned friend, Reverend G. P. Badger, in mixing bars and acute\r\naccents; the former unpleasantly remind man of those hateful dactyls\r\nand spondees, and the latter should, in my humble opinion, be applied\r\nto long vowels which in Arabic double, or should double, the length of\r\nthe shorts. Dr. Badger uses the acute symbol to denote accent or stress\r\nof voice; but such appoggio is unknown to those who speak with\r\npurest articulation; for instance whilst the European pronounces Muscat’,\r\nand the Arab villager Mas’-kat; the Children of the Waste, “\r\nthe Badawi pronunciation. Yet I prefer “Shelebi” (a dandy) from the\r\nTurkish Chelebi, to “Shalabi;” “Zebdani” (the Syrian village) to\r\n“Zabdani,” and “Fes and Miknes” (by the figure Imálah) to “Fás and\r\nMiknás,” our “Fez and Mequinez.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With respect to proper names and untranslated Arabic words I have\r\nrejected all system in favour of common sense. When a term is\r\nincorporated in our tongue, I refuse to follow the purist and mortify\r\nthe reader by startling innovation. For instance, Aleppo, Cairo and\r\nBassorah are preferred to Halab, Kahirah and Al-Basrah; when a word\r\nis half-naturalised, like Alcoran or Koran, Bashaw or Pasha, which the\r\nFrench write Pacha; and Mahomet or Mohammed (for Muhammad),\r\nthe modern form is adopted because the more familiar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I see no advantage in retaining, simply because they are the mistakes of a past\r\ngeneration, such words as “Roc” (for Rikh), Khalif (a pretentious blunder\r\nfor Kalífah and better written Caliph) and “genie” (= Jinn) a mere\r\nGallic corruption not so terrible, however, as “a Bedouin” (= Badawi).\r\nAs little too would I follow Mr. Lane in foisting upon the public such\r\nArabisms as “Khuff” (a riding boot), “Mikra’ah” (a palm-rod) and a\r\nhost of others for which we have good English equivalents. On the\r\nother hand I would use, but use sparingly, certain Arabic exclamations,\r\nas “Bismillah” (= in the name of Allah!) and “Inshallah” (= if Allah\r\nplease!), which have special applications and which have been made\r\nfamiliar to English ears by the genius of Fraser and Morier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I here end these desultory but necessary details to address the\r\nreader in a few final words. He will not think lightly of my work when\r\nI repeat to him that with the aid of my annotations supplementing\r\nLane’s, the student will readily and pleasantly learn more of the\r\nMoslem’s manners and customs, laws and religion than is known to the\r\naverage Orientalist; and, if my labours induce him to attack the text of</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nights he will become master of much more Arabic than the\r\nordinary Arab owns. This book is indeed a legacy which I bequeath to\r\nmy fellow-countrymen in their hour of need. Over devotion to Hindu,\r\nand especially to Sanskrit literature, has led them astray from those\r\n(so-called) “Semitic” studies, which are the more requisite for us as\r\nthey teach us to deal successfully with a race more powerful than any\r\npagans — the Moslem. Apparently England is ever forgetting that she\r\nis at present the greatest Mohammedan empire in the world. Of late\r\nyears she has systematically neglected Arabism and, indeed, actively\r\ndiscouraged it in examinations for the Indian Civil Service, where it is\r\nincomparably more valuable than Greek and Latin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, when\r\nsuddenly compelled to assume the reins of government in Moslem\r\nlands, as Afghanistan in times past and Egypt at present, she fails after\r\na fashion which scandalises her few (very few) friends; and her crass\r\nignorance concerning the Oriental peoples which should most interest\r\nher, exposes her to the contempt of Europe as well as of the Eastern\r\nworld. When the regrettable raids of 1883-84, culminating in the miserable\r\naffairs of Tokar, Teb and Tamasi, were made upon the gallant\r\nSudani negroids, the Bisharin outlying Sawakin, who were battling for\r\nthe holy cause of liberty and religion and for escape from Turkish taskmasters\r\nand Egyptian tax-gatherers, not an English official in camp,\r\nafter the death of the gallant and lamented Major Morice, was capable\r\nof speaking Arabic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now they are not to be ruled by raw youths\r\nwho should be at school and college instead of holding positions of\r\ntrust and emolument. He who would deal with them successfully must\r\nbe, firstly, honest and truthful and, secondly, familiar with and favourably\r\ninclined to their manners and customs if not to their law and\r\nreligion. We may, perhaps, find it hard to restore to England those\r\npristine virtues, that tone and temper, which made her what she is; but\r\nat any rate we (myself and a host of others) can offer her the means of\r\ndispelling her ignorance concerning the Eastern races with whom she\r\nis continually in contact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In conclusion I must not forget to notice that the Arabic ornamentations\r\nof these volumes were designed by my excellent friend Yacoub\r\nArtin Pasha, of the Ministry of Instruction, Cairo, with the aid of the\r\nwell-known writing artist, Shaykh Mohammed Muunis the Cairene.\r\nMy name, Al-Hajj Abdullah (= the Pilgrim Abdallah) was written by an\r\nEnglish calligrapher, the lamented Professor Palmer who found a premature\r\ndeath almost within sight of Suez.</p>', 1, '2018-12-13 20:17:27'),
(19, 'Forward to 1001 Arabian Nights - Part 2', 'Why not an even 1000 nights? Why not 1002 nights, for that matter?', '<p>Without the Nights no Arabian Nights! \r\nMoreover it is necessary to retain the whole apparatus: nothing\r\nmore ill-advised than Dr. Jonathan Scott’s strange device of garnishing\r\nThe Nights with fancy head-pieces and tail-pieces or the splitting-up\r\nof Galland''s narrative by merely prefixing “Nuit,” etc., ending moreover,\r\nwith the ccxxxivth Night: yet this has been done, apparently with\r\nthe consent of the great Arabist Sylvestre de Sacy (Paris, Ernest\r\nBourdin). Moreover, holding that the translator’s glory is to add\r\nsomething to his native tongue, while avoiding the hideous hag-like\r\nnakedness of Torrens and the bald literalism of Lane, I have carefully\r\nEnglished the picturesque turns and novel expressions of the original\r\nin all their outlandishness; for instance, when the dust-cloud raised by\r\na tramping host is described as “walling the horizon.” Hence peculiar\r\nattention has been paid to the tropes and figures which the Arabic\r\nlanguage often packs into a single term; and I have never hesitated to\r\ncoin a word when wanted, such as “she snorted and sparked,” fully to\r\nrepresent the original. These, like many in Rabelais, are mere barbarisms\r\nunless generally adopted; in which case they become civilised\r\nand common currency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite objections manifold and manifest, I have preserved the\r\nbalance of sentences and the prose rhyme and rhythm which Easterns\r\nlook upon as mere music. This “Saj’a,” or cadence of the cooing dove,\r\nhas in Arabic its special duties. It adds a sparkle to description and a\r\npoint to proverb, epigram and dialogue; it corresponds with our “artful\r\nalliteration” (which in places I have substituted for it) and, generally,\r\nit defines the boundaries between the classical and the popular styles\r\nwhich jostle each other in The Nights. If at times it appear strained\r\nand forced, after the wont of rhymed prose, the scholar will observe\r\nthat, despite the immense copiousness of assonants and consonants in\r\nArabic, the strain is often put upon it intentionally, like the Rims cars of\r\nDante and the Troubadours. This rhymed prose may be “un-English”\r\nand unpleasant, even irritating to the British ear; still I look upon it\r\nas a sine quâ non for a complete reproduction of the original. In the\r\nterminal Essay I shall revert to the subject.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand when treating the versical portion, which may\r\nrepresent a total of ten thousand lines, I have not always bound myself\r\nby the metrical bonds of the Arabic, which are artificial in the extreme,\r\nand which in English can be made bearable only by a tour de force.\r\nI allude especially to the monorhyme, Rim continuat or tirade monorime,\r\nwhose monotonous simplicity was preferred by the Troubadours\r\nfor threnodies. It may serve well for three or four couplets but, when it\r\nextends, as in the Ghazal-canzon, to eighteen, and in the Kasidah, elegy\r\nor ode, to more, it must either satisfy itself with banal rhyme words,\r\nwhen the assonants should as a rule be expressive and emphatic; or, it\r\nmust display an ingenuity, a smell of the oil, which assuredly does not\r\nadd to the reader’s pleasure. It can perhaps be done and it should be\r\ndone; but for me the task has no attractions: I can fence better in shoes\r\nthan in sabots. Finally I print the couplets in Arab form separating the\r\nhemistichs by asterisks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And now to consider one matter of special importance in the book\r\n— its turpiloquium. This stumbling-block is of two kinds, completely\r\ndistinct. One is the simple, naïve and child-like indecency which, from\r\nTangiers to Japan, occurs throughout general conversation of high and\r\nlow in the present day. It uses, like the holy books of the Hebrews,\r\nexpressions “plainly descriptive of natural situations;” and it treats in\r\nan unconventionally free and naked manner of subjects and matters\r\nwhich are usually, by common consent, left undescribed. As Sir\r\nWilliam Jones observed long ago, “that anything natural can be offensively\r\nobscene never seems to have occurred to the Indians or to their\r\nlegislators; a singularity (?) pervading their writings and conversation,\r\nbut no proof of moral depravity.” Another justly observes, Les peuples\r\nprimitifs n’y entendent pas malice: ils appellent les choses par leurs noms et\r\nne trouvent pas condamnable ce qui est naturel. And they are prying as\r\nchildren. For instance the European novelist marries off his hero and\r\nheroine and leaves them to consummate marriage in privacy; even Tom\r\nJones has the decency to bolt the door.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>But the Eastern story-teller,\r\nespecially this unknown “prose Shakespeare,” must usher you, with a\r\nflourish, into the bridal chamber and narrate to you, with infinite gusto,\r\neverything he sees and hears. Again we must remember that grossness\r\nand indecency, in fact les turpitudes, are matters of time and place; what\r\nis offensive in England is not so in Egypt; what scandalises us now\r\nwould have been a tame joke tempore Elisae. Withal The Nights will not\r\nbe found in this matter coarser than many passages of Shakespeare,\r\nSterne, and Swift, and their uncleanness rarely attains the perfection of\r\nAlcofribas Naiser, “divin maître et atroce cochon.” The other element\r\nis absolute obscenity, sometimes, but not always, tempered by wit,\r\nhumour and drollery; here we have an exaggeration of Petronius\r\nArbiter, the handiwork of writers whose ancestry, the most religious\r\nand the most debauched of mankind, practised every abomination\r\nbefore the shrine of the Canopic Gods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In accordance with my purpose of reproducing the Nights, not\r\nvirginibus puerisque, but in as perfect a picture as my powers permit,\r\nI have carefully sought out the English equivalent of every Arabic\r\nword, however low it may be or “shocking” to ears polite; preserving,\r\non the other hand, all possible delicacy where the indecency is not\r\nintentional; and, as a friend advises me to state, not exaggerating the\r\nvulgarities and the indecencies which, indeed, can hardly be exaggerated.\r\nFor the coarseness and crassness are but the shades of a\r\npicture which would otherwise be all lights. The general tone of The\r\nNights is exceptionally high and pure. The devotional fervour often\r\nrises to the boiling point of fanaticism. The pathos is sweet, deep and\r\ngenuine; tender, simple and true, utterly unlike much of our modern\r\ntinsel. Its life, strong, splendid and multitudinous, is everywhere\r\nflavoured with that unaffected pessimism and constitutional melancholy\r\nwhich strike deepest root under the brightest skies and which\r\nsigh in the face of heaven: —\r\nVita quid est hominis? Viridis floriscula mortis;\r\nSole Oriente oriens, sole cadente cadens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Poetical justice is administered by the literary Kází with exemplary\r\nimpartiality and severity; “denouncing evil doers and eulogising deeds\r\nadmirably achieved.” The morale is sound and healthy; and at times we\r\ndescry, through the voluptuous and libertine picture, vistas of a transcendental\r\nmorality, the morality of Socrates in Plato. Subtle corruption\r\nand covert licentiousness are utterly absent; we find more real “vice” in\r\nmany a short French roman, say La Dame aux Camelias, and in not a\r\nfew English novels of our day than in the thousands of pages of the\r\nArab. Here we have nothing of that most immodest modern modesty\r\nwhich sees covert implication where nothing is implied, and “improper”\r\nallusion when propriety is not outraged; nor do we meet with\r\nthe Nineteenth Century refinement; innocence of the word not of the\r\nthought; morality of the tongue not of the heart, and the sincere\r\nhomage paid to virtue in guise of perfect hypocrisy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is, indeed, this\r\nunique contrast of a quaint element, childish crudities and nursery\r\nindecencies and “vain and amatorious” phrase jostling the finest and\r\nhighest views of life and character, shown in the kaleidoscopic shiftings\r\nof the marvellous picture with many a “rich truth in a tale’s pretence;”\r\npointed by a rough dry humour which compares well with “wut;” the\r\nalternations of strength and weakness, of pathos and bathos, of the\r\nboldest poetry (the diction of Job) and the baldest prose (the Egyptian\r\nof to-day); the contact of religion and morality with the orgies of\r\nAfrican Apuleius and Petronius Arbiter — at times taking away the\r\nreader’s breath — and, finally, the whole dominated everywhere by that\r\nmarvellous Oriental fancy, wherein the spiritual and the supernatural\r\nare as common as the material and the natural; it is this contrast, I say,\r\nwhich forms the chiefest charm of The Nights, which gives it the most\r\nstriking originality and which makes it a perfect expositor of the\r\nmedieval Moslem mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explanatory notes did not enter into Mr. Payne’s plan. They do\r\nwith mine:* I can hardly imagine The Nights being read to any profit\r\nby men of the West without commentary. My annotations avoid only\r\none subject, parallels of European folk-lore and fabliaux which, however\r\ninteresting, would overswell the bulk of a book whose speciality is\r\nanthropology. The accidents of my life, it may be said without undue\r\npresumption, my long dealings with Arabs and other Mahommedans,\r\nand my familiarity not only with their idiom but with their turn of\r\nthought, and with that racial individuality which baffles description,\r\nhave given me certain advantages over the average student, however\r\ndeeply he may have studied. These volumes, moreover, afford me a\r\nlong sought opportunity of noticing practices and customs which\r\ninterest all mankind and which “Society” will not hear mentioned.\r\n* For this edition only a small portion of Burton’s notes was retained; see About this\r\nEdition, p. 6.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grate, the historian, and Thackeray, the novelist, both lamented that\r\nthe bégueulerie of their countrymen condemned them to keep silence\r\nwhere publicity was required; and that they could not even claim the\r\npartial licence of a Fielding and a Smollett. Hence a score of years ago\r\nI lent my best help to the late Dr. James Hunt in founding the Anthropological\r\nSociety, whose presidential chair I first occupied (pp. 2-4\r\nAnthropologia; London, Balliere, vol. i., No. 1, 1873). My motive was to\r\nsupply travellers with an organ which would rescue their observations\r\nfrom the outer darkness of manuscript, and print their curious information\r\non social and sexual matters out of place in the popular book\r\nintended for the Nipptisch and indeed better kept from public view.\r\nBut, hardly had we begun when “Respectability,” that whited sepulchre\r\nfull of all uncleanness, rose up against us. “Propriety” cried us down\r\nwith her brazen blatant voice, and the weak-kneed brethren fell away.\r\nYet the organ was much wanted and is wanted still.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All now known\r\nbarbarous tribes in Inner Africa, America and Australia, whose instincts\r\nhave not been overlaid by reason, have a ceremony which they\r\ncall “making men.” As soon as the boy shows proofs of puberty, he and\r\nhis coevals are taken in hand by the mediciner and the Fetisheer; and,\r\nunder priestly tuition, they spend months in the “bush,” enduring\r\nhardships and tortures which impress the memory till they have\r\nmastered the “theorick and practick” of social and sexual relations.\r\nAmongst the civilised this fruit of the knowledge-tree must be bought\r\nat the price of the bitterest experience, and the consequences of\r\nignorance are peculiarly cruel. Here, then, I find at last an opportunity\r\nof noticing in explanatory notes many details of the text which would\r\nescape the reader’s observation, and I am confident that they will form\r\na repertory of Eastern knowledge in its esoteric phase. The student\r\nwho adds the notes of Lane (“Arabian Society,” etc., before quoted)\r\nto mine will know as much of the Moslem East and more than many\r\nEuropeans who have spent half their lives in Orient lands. For facility\r\nof reference an index of anthropological notes is appended to each\r\nvolume.*</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reader will kindly bear with the following technical details.\r\nSteinhaeuser and I began and ended our work with the first Bulak\r\n(“Bul.”) Edition printed at the port of Cairo in A.H. 1251 = A.D. 1835.\r\nBut when preparing my MSS. for print I found the text incomplete,\r\nmany of the stories being given in epitome and not a few ruthlessly\r\nmutilated with head or feet wanting. Like most Eastern scribes the\r\nEditor could not refrain from “improvements,” which only debased the\r\nbook; and his sole title to excuse is that the second Bulak Edition\r\n(4 vols. A.H. 1279 = A.D. 1863), despite its being “revised and corrected\r\nby Sheik Mahommed Qotch Al-Adewi,” is even worse; and the\r\nsame may be said of the Cairo Edit. (4 vols. A.H. 1297 = A.D. 1881).\r\nThe Calcutta (“Calc.”) Edition, with ten lines of Persian preface by the\r\nEditor, Ahmed al-Shirwani (A.D. 1814), was cut short at the end of the\r\nfirst two hundred Nights, and thus made room for Sir William Hay\r\nMacnaghten’s Edition (4 vols. royal 4to) of 1839-42.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This (“Mac.”),\r\nas by far the least corrupt and the most complete, has been assumed\r\nfor my basis with occasional reference to the Breslau Edition (“Bres.”)\r\nwretchedly edited from a hideous Egyptian MS. by Dr. Maximilian\r\nHabicht (1825-43). The Bayrut Text “Alif-Leila we Leila” (4 vols. gt.\r\n8vo, Beirut, 1881-83) is a melancholy specimen of The Nights taken\r\nentirely from the Bulak Edition by one Khalil Sarkis and converted to\r\nChristianity; beginning without Bismillah, continued with scrupulous\r\n* These indexes are omitted from the volumes of the present edition.</p>\r\n', 1, '2018-12-13 20:18:18'),
(20, 'Forward to 1001 Arabian Nights - Part 3', 'The ultimate bedtime stories', '<p>This work, labourious as it may appear, has been to me a labour of\r\nlove, an unfailing source of solace and satisfaction. During my long\r\nyears of official banishment to the luxuriant and deadly deserts of\r\nWestern Africa, and to the dull and dreary half clearings of South\r\nAmerica, it proved itself a charm, a talisman against ennui and\r\ndespondency. Impossible even to open the pages without a vision\r\nstarting into view; without drawing a picture from the pinacothek of\r\nthe brain; without reviving a host of memories and reminiscences\r\nwhich are not the common property of travellers, however widely they\r\nmay have travelled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From my dull and commonplace and “respectable”\r\nsurroundings, the Jinn bore me at once to the land of my predilection,\r\nArabia, a region so familiar to my mind that even at first sight, it\r\nseemed a reminiscence of some by-gone metem-psychic life in the\r\ndistant Past. Again I stood under the diaphanous skies, in air glorious\r\nas aether, whose every breath raises men’s spirits like sparkling wine.\r\nOnce more I saw the evening star hanging like a solitaire from the pure\r\nfront of the western firmament; and the after-glow transfiguring and\r\ntransforming, as by magic, the homely and rugged features of the scene\r\ninto a fairy-land lit with a light which never shines on other soils or\r\nseas. Then would appear the woollen tents, low and black, of the true\r\nBadawin, mere dots in the boundless waste of lion-tawny clays and\r\ngazelle-brown gravels, and the camp fire dotting like a glow-worm the\r\nvillage centre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Presently, sweetened by distance, would be heard the\r\nwild weird song of lads and lasses, driving or rather pelting, through\r\nthe gloaming their sheep and goats; and the measured chant of the\r\nspearsmen gravely stalking behind their charge, the camels; mingled\r\nwith bleating of the flocks and the bellowing of the humpy herds;\r\nwhile the reremouse flitted overhead with his tiny shriek, and the rave\r\nof the jackal resounded through deepening glooms, and — most\r\nmusical of music — the palm trees answered the whispers of the nightbreeze\r\nwith the softest tones of falling water.\r\nAnd then a shift of scene. The Shaykhs and “white-beards” of the\r\ntribe gravely take their places, sitting with outspread skirts like hillocks\r\non the plain, as the Arabs say, around the camp-fire, whilst I reward\r\ntheir hospitality and secure its continuance by reading or reciting a few\r\npages of their favourite tales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The women and children stand motionless\r\nas silhouettes outside the ring; and all are breathless with attention;\r\nthey seem to drink in the words with eyes and mouths as well as with\r\nears. The most fantastic flights of fancy, the wildest improbabilities, the\r\nmost impossible of impossibilities, appear to them utterly natural, mere\r\nmatters of every-day occurrence. They enter thoroughly into each\r\nphase of feeling touched upon by the author: they take a personal\r\npride in the chivalrous nature and to light mention of the sex whose name is never heard amongst the nobility of the Desert. Nor was it only in Arabia that the immortal Nights did me such notable service: I found the wildlings of Somali-land equally amenable\r\nto its discipline; no one was deaf to the charm and the two womencooks\r\nof my caravan, on its way to Harar, were incontinently dubbed\r\nby my men “Shahrazad” and “Dinazad.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It may be permitted me also to note that this translation is a natural\r\noutcome of my Pilgrimage to Al-Medinah and Meccah. Arriving at\r\nAden in the (so-called) winter of 1852, I put up with my old and dear\r\nfriend, Steinhaeuser, to whose memory this volume is inscribed; and,\r\nwhen talking over Arabia and the Arabs, we at once came to the same\r\nconclusion that, while the name of this wondrous treasury of Moslem\r\nfolk-lore is familiar to almost every English child, no general reader is\r\naware of the valuables it contains, nor indeed will the door open to any\r\nbut Arabists. Before parting we agreed to “collaborate” and produce a\r\nfull, complete, unvarnished, uncastrated copy of the great original, my\r\nfriend taking the prose and I the metrical part; and we corresponded\r\nupon the subject for years. But whilst I was in the Brazil, Steinhaeuser\r\ndied suddenly of apoplexy at Berne in Switzerland and, after the\r\nfashion of Anglo-India, his valuable MSS. left at Aden were dispersed,\r\nand very little of his labours came into my hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus I was left alone to my work, which progressed fitfully amid a\r\nhost of obstructions. At length, in the spring of 1879, the tedious\r\nprocess of copying began and the book commenced to take finished\r\nform. But, during the winter of 1881-82, I saw in the literary journals a\r\nnotice of a new version by Mr. John Payne, well known to scholars\r\nfor his prowess in English verse, especially for his translation of “The\r\nPoems of Master Francis Villon, of Paris.” Being then engaged on an\r\nexpedition to the Gold Coast (for gold), which seemed likely to cover\r\nsome months, I wrote to the “Athenaeum” (Nov. 13, 1881) and to Mr.\r\nPayne, who was wholly unconscious that we were engaged on the same\r\nwork, and freely offered him precedence and possession of the field till\r\nno longer wanted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He accepted my offer as frankly, and his priority\r\nentailed another delay lasting till the spring of 1885. These details will\r\npartly account for the lateness of my appearing, but there is yet another\r\ncause. Professional ambition suggested that literary labours, unpopular\r\nwith the vulgar and the half educated, are not likely to help a man up\r\nthe ladder of promotion. But common sense presently suggested to me\r\nthat, professionally speaking, I was not a success, and, at the same time,\r\nthat I had no cause to be ashamed of my failure. In our day, when we\r\nlive under a despotism of the lower “middle class” Philister who can\r\npardon anything but superiority, the prizes of competitive services are\r\nmonopolized by certain “pets” of the Médiocratie, and prime favourites\r\nof that jealous and potent majority — the Mediocrities who know\r\n“no nonsense about merit.” It is hard for an outsider to realise how\r\nperfect is the monopoly of commonplace, and to comprehend how\r\nfatal a stumbling-stone that man sets in the way of his own advancement\r\nwho dares to think for himself, or who knows more or who does\r\nmore than the mob of gentlemen-employés who know very little and\r\nwho do even less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, however behindhand I may be, there is still ample room and\r\nverge for an English version of the “Arabian Nights’ Entertainments.”\r\nOur century of translations, popular and vernacular, from (Professor\r\nAntoine) Galland’s delightful abbreviation and adaptation (A.D.\r\n1704), in no wise represent the eastern original. The best and latest,\r\nthe Rev. Mr. Foster’s, which is diffuse and verbose, and Mr. G. Moir\r\nBussey’s, which is a re-correction, abound in gallicisms of style and\r\nidiom; and one and all degrade a chef d’oeuvre of the highest anthropological\r\nand ethnographical interest and importance to a mere fairybook,\r\na nice present for little boys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After nearly a century had elapsed, Dr. Jonathan Scott (LL.D.\r\nH.E.I.C.’s S., Persian Secretary to the G. G. Bengal; Oriental Professor,\r\netc., etc.), printed his “Tales, Anecdotes, and Letters, translated\r\nfrom the Arabic and Persian,” (Cadell and Davies, London, A.D.\r\n1800); and followed in 1811 with an edition of “The Arabian Nights’\r\nEntertainments” from the MS. of Edward Wortley Montague (in 6\r\nvols., small 8vo, London: Longmans, etc.). This work he (and he only)\r\ndescribes as “Carefully revised and occasionally corrected from the\r\nArabic.” The reading public did not wholly reject it, sundry texts were\r\nfounded upon the Scott version and it has been imperfectly reprinted\r\n(4 vols., 8vo, Nimmo and Bain, London, 1883).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But most men, little recking what a small portion of the original they were reading, satisfied themselves with the Anglo French epitome and metaphrase. At length\r\nin 1838, Mr. Henry Torrens, B.A., Irishman, lawyer (“of the Inner\r\nTemple”) and Bengal Civilian, took a step in the right direction; and\r\nbegan to translate, “The Book of the Thousand Nights and One\r\nNight,” (1 vol., 8vo, Calcutta: W. Thacker and Co.) from the Arabic of\r\nthe Aegyptian (!) MS. edited by Mr. (afterwards Sir) William H. Macnaghten.\r\nThe attempt, or rather the intention, was highly creditable;\r\nthe copy was carefully moulded upon the model and offered the best\r\nexample of the verbatim et literatim style. But the plucky author knew\r\nlittle of Arabic, and least of what is most wanted, the dialect of Egypt\r\nand Syria. His prose is so conscientious as to offer up spirit at the\r\nshrine of letter; and his verse, always whimsical, has at times a manner\r\nof Hibernian whoop which is comical when it should be pathetic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly he printed only one volume of a series which completed would\r\nhave contained nine or ten. That amiable and devoted Arabist, the late \r\nEdward William Lane does not score a success in his “New Translation of the Tales of a\r\nThousand and One Nights” (London: Charles Knight and Co.,\r\nMDCCCXXXIX.) of which there have been four English editions,\r\nbesides American, two edited by E. S. Poole. He chose the abbreviating\r\nBulak Edition; and, of its two hundred tales, he has omitted about\r\nhalf and by far the more characteristic half: the work was intended\r\nfor “the drawing-room table;” and, consequently, the workman was\r\ncompelled to avoid the “objectionable” and aught “approaching to\r\nlicentiousness.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He converts the Arabian Nights into the Arabian\r\nChapters, arbitrarily changing the division and, worse still, he converts\r\nsome chapters into notes. He renders poetry by prose and apologises\r\nfor not omitting it altogether: he neglects assonance and he is at once\r\ntoo Oriental and not Oriental enough. He had small store of Arabic at\r\nthe time — Lane of the Nights is not Lane of the Dictionary — and his\r\npages are disfigured by many childish mistakes. Worst of all, the three\r\nhandsome volumes are rendered unreadable as Sale’s Koran by their\r\nanglicised Latin, their sesquipedalian un-English words, and the stiff\r\nand stilted style of half a century ago when our prose was, perhaps, the\r\nworst in Europe. Their cargo of Moslem learning was most valuable to\r\nthe student, but utterly out of place for readers of “The Nights;” republished,\r\nas these notes have been separately (London, Chatto, 1883),\r\nthey are an ethnological text book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. John Payne has printed, for the I cannot but feel proud that he has honoured me with the dedication of “The Book of The Thousand Nights and One Night.” His version\r\nis most readable: his English, with a sub-flavour of the Mabinogionic\r\narchaicism, is admirable; and his style gives life and light to the nine\r\nvolumes whose matter is frequently heavy enough. He succeeds admirably\r\nin the most difficult passages and he often hits upon choice and\r\nspecial terms and the exact vernacular equivalent of the foreign word,\r\nso happily and so picturesquely that all future translators must perforce\r\nuse the same expression under pain of falling far short. But the learned\r\nand versatile author bound himself to issue only five hundred copies,\r\nand “not to reproduce the work in its complete and uncastrated form.”\r\nConsequently his excellent version is caviaire to the general — practically\r\nunprocurable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And here I hasten to confess that ample use has been made of\r\nthe three versions above noted, the whole being blended by a callida\r\njunctura into a homogeneous mass. But in the presence of so many\r\npredecessors a writer is bound to show some raison d’etre for making\r\na fresh attempt and this I proceed to do with due reserve.\r\nBriefly, the object of this version is to show what “The Thousand\r\nNights and a Night” really is. Not, however, for reasons to be more fully\r\nstated in the terminal Essay, by straining verbum reddere verbo, but by\r\nwriting as the Arab would have written in English. On this point I am\r\nall with Saint Jerome (Pref. in Jobum) “Vel verbum e verbo, vel sensum\r\ne sensu, vel ex utroque commixtum, et medic temperatum genus translationis.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My work claims to be a faithful copy of the great Eastern\r\nSaga-book, by preserving intact, not only the spirit, but even the\r\nmécanique, the manner and the matter. Hence, however prosy and longdrawn\r\nout be the formula, it retains the scheme of The Nights because\r\nthey are a prime feature in the original. The Ráwí or reciter, to whose\r\nwits the task of supplying details is left, well knows their value: the\r\nopenings carefully repeat the names of the dramatic personae and thus\r\nfix them in the hearer’s memory.</p>\r\n\r\n', 1, '2018-12-13 20:18:52');
